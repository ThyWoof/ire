IRE license
===========

The IT-HE Role-Playing-Game Engine (IRE) is issued under the terms of the
BSD license, described in the following section.

There are, unfortunately, one or two complications, mostly in regard
to the FMOD audio library that IRE uses.  This is optional, though I find
it gives the best results.

If you're going to use a version of IRE that is built with FMOD (one that
contains the fmod.dll or fmod.so libraries), make sure you read and obey the
section about FMOD.


License Provisios
=================

* The BSD license applies only to the game runtime engine, the editors
  and accompanying utilities that form the IRE distribution.  It does not
  apply to any third-party components (such as libraries or toolkits)
  which are licensed separately and may have additional legal requirements.

  (For example, the MSVC runtime libraries, the GCC runtimes,  Allegro,
   SDL, FMOD and BGUI2)

* Furthermore, datafiles which make up an IRE game do not necessarily fall
  under the BSD license.  The demo game that comes with the original IRE
  package (titled 'The Flat') is placed in the public domain and may be used
  as a base for further games.

* BGUI2 is licensed as Giftware, like the Allegro library which it is an
  add-on for.  I have made a few modifications to it to keep it working
  since it's kind of long in the tooth nowadays.
  It is (or should be) possible to compile IRE and the editor without
  using BGUI at all, but it won't look as pretty.

* Any game data created for or using IRE may be licensed as the author of
  that work sees fit (FMOD licensing notwithstanding) although they are
  encouraged to make their work available in a liberal manner.


FMOD Licensing
==============

FMOD is an optional sound library for Windows and Linux.  It provides
high-quality audio playback, and is used by default in the Windows
version.  The Linux version uses SDL by default, though it can also be
built with FMOD or the lower-quality Allegro library if you prefer.

If you're going to use or distribute a version of IRE that includes FMOD,
read this section.  Otherwise skip it and go straight on to the BSD license.

* When distributing a game made with IRE, you will have to seek a separate
  license agreement to redistribute the proprietary FMOD sound library that
  the IRE runtime often uses by default.  The files in question are either
  fmod*.so or fmod*.dll, depending on whether it's Linux or Windows.  The
  '*' denotes a version number and is subject to change.

* For non-commercial games this license will be free of charge.  For
  shareware and commercial games, you will have to purchase a license
  from Firelight Technologies.

  See http://www.fmod.org for details.

* According to Firelight, the act of a commercial organisation distributing
  a free game at profit (e.g. on a magazine coverdisk) does not constitute
  a commercial work, i.e. this is allowed without payment.

* Alternatively, if you don't like this, you can produce a fully Free
  version of the IRE runtime by disabling the game's use of FMOD, and using
  the less fully-featured Allegro sound driver instead, or the SDL driver,
  (note that the SDL driver does not yet work under Windows, however.)

  Details for doing this are in 'readme.src'.
