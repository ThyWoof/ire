smooth, effortless manner.

"I'm a Mark 8 panther.  We're robot cats manufactured to
 defend military installations.

 I distinguished myself some years ago in our war against
 the human rebels, and was upgraded to full human-level
 intelligence.

 Most of my guards fall rather short of this mark, but
 they are loyal soldiers, and the ones who show great
 initiative or compassion will be rewarded.  A few will
 even join me as subordinates."

"They're immature.  We reproduce asexually, as I am sure
 you are aware.  Our bodies are manufactured, and our
 brains are all programmed from a master template.

 This results in a squadron of identical panthers.  But
 over the course of the years, they gradually diverge
 into separate entities."

"Some will be content to remain as grunts, others will
 develop the cunning they need to rise through the ranks.
 The compassionate ones may suddenly realise that when
 they attack they are hurting another creature like
 themselves.  They usually want to leave the military and
 go freelance, or try a totally different career.

 The finest, such as I, will form a balance between all
 three extremes.  This is the stuff of which captains
 are made."

"Most of my guards are panthers, similar to myself.
 There are also a few human guards as well, since some
 duties are better carried out on two legs than four.

 The reception at the base gates is one of these.
 Even in this day and age there are still some humans who
 dislike talking to a cyber.  Since most of the humans
 went medieval, this has become even more of a problem."

 He is smart and loyal, but has not yet earned himself a

 I would greatly appreciate it if you could take him as

 But there are a few minor issues you should be aware of."

 There should be one in a spare locker.. I forget exactly
 where.   If JMAC keeps quiet, they'll think he's a pet."

"And secondly: maintenance and repair.

 JMAC is heavily armoured and has some self-repair
 capabilities, but you can't heal him by yourself.

 If you bring him back to us, Austin can fix him up, and
 any of the other bases should be able to repair him too.

 If the worst happens and he dies, you MUST bring back
 his head, otherwise we can't resurrect him."

The panther looks at Darien.

"I see you've brought one of the Churchies with you.
 I hope you know what you're doing.. we've had nothing
 but trouble from them."

"Watch your tongue, hell-cat!"

"See what I mean?   Well, if you get sick of him, I'm
 sure I could lend you one of my underlings."


"In the ???? you should find a certain Panther JMAC.
 He's pretty intelligent, but has not yet earned himself
 a name of his own.

 If you feel he would be useful, I'll let him join your
 party.

 Are you interested in this?"



"Good!  That sort of training is a rare opportunity.
 Now, a few words before you actually take him.

 Firstly, JMAC is a stock design like me, which means
 that he has glowing red eyes and a shiny black metal
 hide.  The Churchies won't like that at all, so I
 suggest you get him a fur suit.

 There should be one in a spare locker.. I forget exactly
 where.   If JMAC keeps quiet, they'll think he's a pet."

JMAC: "Oh no.. not again.."

"One more important note: maintenance and repair.

 JMAC is heavily armoured, but won't heal by himself.
 If you bring him back to us, Austin can fix him up.
 I suspect the other bases can repair him too.
 If the worst happens and he dies, you MUST bring back
 his head."
