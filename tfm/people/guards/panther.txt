You see some kind of robot panther.  The creature speaks
in a somewhat clumsy and deliberate manner.

"I am a Mark 8 panther.  We are semi-autonomous guard
 robots manufactured for the purpose of defending
 military installations."

"I am $NAME.  We are not usually granted names until we
 have distinguished ourselves though an act of bravery,
 compassion or valour.

 I am still awaiting such an opportunity."

"As well as the honour of being allowed to take a name
 instead of a serial number, and that we have proved we
 are properly self-aware, we are also granted a permanent
 system upgrade to improve our intelligence, strength or
 some other attribute.  Usually such upgrades are only
 enabled for the duration of an individual mission.

 If you wish to meet one who has been so honoured, seek
 our captain, who can be found in the guard room.  He has
 brought honour to himself many times and has been
 upgraded to full human-level intelligence.. a state that
 many of us covet, but few attain."

Without consulting any kind of timepiece, the creature
answers immediately.
