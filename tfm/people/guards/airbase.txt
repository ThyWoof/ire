"This is New Fairford airbase.

 This facility is a restricted area, so I must ask you to
 leave if you don't have the proper authorisation."

"You can't.  If the Commander wants to see you, he'll
 authorise your entry.

 There were crippling attacks in the past by visitors who
 seemed to be harmless..  We've learned a hard lesson."

 A superb strategist, but he knows how to treat people."
