"Good, citizen.

 This warrent entitles you to five sacks of grain.
 I will help move them outside.

 Take care when you visit the mill.. there are many
 devils in the woods of late, to say nothing of snakes.

 It would be wise to go armed."

"I do not see the warrant.

 You must have a warrant for the grain to be transferred
 signed by the King or one of his deputies.

 Without this I cannot let you take any grain."

 If the King accepts your petition for some grain, you
 will be given a warrant for it to be milled.

 I cannot help you without such a warrant."

 The LORD does not smile upon thieves and you could be

 If you do not have a warrant to take the grain, please
