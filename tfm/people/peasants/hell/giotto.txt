"In my time I was a gifted painter.  Alas, my final painting saw me burned for heresy.

"This surprises many of the newcomers, but Hell is disputed territory.
 The LORD wishes it as a place of torment for those who have sinned
 against the Trinity.

"The Devil sees it as his realm as the scriptures have often said.
 Those in his territory are treated well, that they may serve him faithfully when the end times come."
