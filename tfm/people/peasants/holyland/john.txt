"It happened nigh two years ago, when we were on our way
 to church for Mass.  My wife stopped upon the way to
 pick roses, and we were made late by her dallying.
 By time we came to church, the Mass was already being
 said, and the Lord Jesus had appeared before the
 congregation to announce new tithes.

 As we approached the pews, the Saviour stopped speaking
 and looked at us sternly.  He said to her, 'I hope you
 like flowers, for you shall need them henceforth!'.

 Then He smote her with a brilliant light."

"I knew not what it all meant at the time, but since that
 day she spoke only her name and profession.  I kneeled
 before the cross and prayed for her, and on the third
 day, the Lord Jesus did answer me.

 He told me that she needed a brew made from a rare
 mountain flower, known as the 'Pinnacle of Ascenscion'.
 I journeyed far to the mountains of Scotia, and after
 journeying through many caves came to a plateau where
 these flowers could be found."

"But now we have run out of the brew, and we have no
 flowers with which to make it.  Some moons ago I set
 off to claim some more, but the caverns have since
 changed in an earthquake, and the only way that I can
 find now is through the lair of the hideous fire-snail.
 I barely escaped with my life!

 I seek a bold warrior who would journey to the wilds of
 North Scotia and bring back these rare flowers on my
 behalf.

 I am a wealthy merchant, and I would pay well."
