St Donald's was given a papal decree from the Holy Father.



A man named Donald did find a way to cook food quickly,
and set up his tavern in the Holy Land.
It was very popular, until his Holiness did find out that
he had used a forbidden technique of the Ancients.  The
Pope approves not of such things, and did martyr Donald
at the stake.  Many did witness his torture and execution.

But as his bones were removed from the stake, the LORD
did appear and waxed wroth at the Holy Father.  So furious
was He, that those who saw do say that the LORD did nearly
martyr his Holiness as well!  Indeed, it be the only known
time that the LORD and the Holy Father did come to blows.

But the LORD did calm, and although Donald does remain dead
even unto this day, he was canonised by order of the LORD,
and his son has been given an Indulgence by the Church to
run his father's tavern.
No other such taverns be permitted, though some do say that
there is a tavern of ill-repute in the deep forests, and
that it be known as the 'KFS'.
