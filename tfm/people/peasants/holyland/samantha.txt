"His Holiness does do most of the cleaning of the
 grand cathedral himself, for he hates mess and uses
 the power of the LORD to ensure all is tidy and good.

 'Tis said that cleanliness is next to godliness, after
 all.

 But still, there are yet tasks which must be done,
 such as replacing his bed linen and tidying his study.
 He does also value the eye of others as might spot
 things which he has missed himself."
