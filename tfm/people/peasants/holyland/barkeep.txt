"Welcome to The Dead Old Man!  What can I get you?"


"It is named after an actor.  Legend has it that the man
 in charge of a an important play cast the lead role to
 a famous actor, even though he had died some time before.
 Apparently used a look-alike after the opening scene.

 Personally, I do not believe the myth but the pub was
 named by my grandsire and I have no wish to change it."


-> By vile necromantic arts he did cause the corpse to rise
   and act upon the stage.  Though it is said he used
   a look-alike after the opening scene.
   At the end of the play, he was taken by the Church for
   his deeds and beheaded outside the grand cathedral.
