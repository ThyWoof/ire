"In the northeast, there lies a fell tower.  Some say
 that it is home to an evil wizard, or even a daemon.
 Tales, there are, of a liche that guards a hoard of
 most fabulous treasure.
 But no-one knows for sure what evil lurks within,
 for the tower is guarded by deadly rabbits."

"Do not jest!  It is horrible!  When an intruder
 approaches the tower, the bunnies do swarm from their
 holes and attack every living thing.  They will
 overpower a man by sheer weight of numbers.

 Many moons ago I did journey there with four heroes,
 in quest to slay the beast that lurks within the tower
 and claim its treasures for our own.
 I saw them all die, the flesh stripped from their bones
 by the gnawing teeth.  I alone survived by sacrificing
 my own feet, that the rest of me could escape."
