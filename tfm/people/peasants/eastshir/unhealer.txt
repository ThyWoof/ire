"My name is $NAME, and I am the evil twin of the healer
 of this town.

 As you may know, Avis is oft visited by many adventurers
 who seek to earn their gold by battling the fell beasts
 which the Evil One sends to devour our livestock and
 our farmers.  A bit like me, I suppose.

 Oftentimes there come men who seek healing by my
 brother, and sometimes they do not pay him.  When this
 happens, I help change their mind.

 If you are interested in my services, you need but ask."

 Or, if you prefer, I'll 'cure' you and throw 7 gold
 coins into the bargain.
 If you let me kill one of your party members, I'll give
 you 600 gold coins."
