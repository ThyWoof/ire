"I was once a captain among King Duncan's guards, but I
 feel that there is little future to be had in his
 employment.  News came of a prophecy made of the King's
 downfall.

 My commision as a guard was nearing its end, so rather
 than stay on and be slain in the coming storm, I chose
 to leave and seek my fortune as a sword for hire."

"There is much need for warriors here, as the town's
 fortunes ride upon the wool trade.  For just as the
 shepherds do prize their sheep for their wool, so too
 do many beasts prize those sheep for their meat.

 The shepherds will pay well to keep their flocks safe
 and in this way, many fortune-hunters earn good living.

 But this may come at a price, as Dunhelm and many others
 have learned to their cost."

Tell me about Dunhelm.

[page="dunhelm"]

"Dunhelm was, like me, an adventurer and he undertook
 many quests.  His great talent lay in vanquishing the
 fell beasts of the Enemy which do on occasion threaten
 our people.

 One day, during a lean winter, a shepherd came to him
 seeking his aid.  His sheep were being preyed upon by
 woolves and he sought a hero to slay the beasts.
 As all know, such deeds are an abomination in the eyes
 of the LORD, and although I tried to stay him, Dunhelm
 foolishly took the quest despite, for he was in need of
 the gold it would earn him."

"Later that day he returned to the tavern where we were
 lodging, and his steel was red with the blood of
 woolves.  As he sat down, the sky outside did become
 black, and as the lightning flared, the Holy Ghost did
 enter into the tavern in the likeness of a great eagle.

 The bird perched upon the rafters and in a shrill voice
 proclaimed to all that Dunhelm of Avis was a shithead,
 and then tore the soul screaming from his body.

 Francis of New Avignon was with us, and he did attempt
 to save Dunhelm from the bird, striking at it with his
 sword.  It gave a piercing shriek and turned him to ash
 with a red light from its eyes."

"But the tale does not end there, for when Dunhelm was
 dead, the bird flew back upon the rafters and proclaimed
 that the shepherd too would pay his price for the fell
 deed which he had bought.

 The shepherd rose and tried to flee, but at that moment
 he too was struck down by the Holy Ghost and became a
 woolf himself.  He fled back to his farm only to be
 confronted with the survivors of the pack he had paid
 Dunhelm to slay.  They drove him from their territory
 and he was cast out into the wilderness."

 Seeing that all understood the severity of the LORD's
 justice for such crimes, the Holy Spirit departed from
 the eagle, which was carried reverently from the tavern
 and released in the town square."
