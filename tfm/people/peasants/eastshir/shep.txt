"Nay, not woolves.  There are woolves, yes, but the
 priests of the LORD have struck a bargain with them
 that they feast only upon rabbits and not my sheep.

 There was a shepherd who commissioned a warrior to hunt
 woolves.. but it did end most horribly.. I will not
 speak of it..

 The enemies of which I speak are fell monsters that come
 from the hills in the north."

"Soldiers?  We have none.  Armies are forbidden by Papal
 decree.

 Only the LORD is permitted soldiers, and His Holiness
 has little interest in the affairs of humble shepherds.
 We have only a handful of guards here to keep law and
 order.  They are too few to fight beasts in the fields.

 We must look instead to wandering adventurers to
 defend our flocks."

"My flock has been invaded by fell sheep which have made
 an horrific pact with the Evil one!  They have
 infiltrated the pen and I dare not enter.

"We never found Farmer Northram's body after last shearing
 season, only his teeth.

 I need a skilled warrior to separate the good sheep from
 the bad, and dispatch the evil ones back to the Hell from
 whence they came."
