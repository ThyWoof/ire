"Who has not heard of the Dragon of Lakeside?
 I am, I think, the only man who has confronted the beast
 and yet lived to speak of it.

 It was twice as long and twice the width of a cow, and
 had sharp teeth and claws.  The sharpest sword cannot
 piece its armour and it can summon up flames, not from
 its breath, but from the walls of the keep.

 Only by feigning death did I manage to escape the beast
 with my life."

> why did you take on the dragon?

I went to try and slay it, to prove myself.
It was a foolish deed.  Since then I have stuck with smaller prey.


"In the depths of the forest, there is an area of dense
 woodland, that some call the Forbidden Forest.
 In it there lies a great pile of gold and jewels, but
 no man may approach it, for it is well-guarded.

 This treasure is guarded by five great Hell-Cats, with
 eyes like coals and claws like razors.  It is said that
 they will slay any man who comes too close to their prize.

 I journeyed to this spot, with twelve other men.
 We thought that by our numbers we could conquer the
 beasts, but it was not to be.  The largest cat rose as
 we approached and snarled, as if to warn us off.

 Our leader ignored it, and we attacked.  Within ten
 seconds, everyone else was dead, their throats torn out.

 I alone survived, for the beasts did not give chase when
 I threw down my sword and fled."

"As adventurers go, I seem to have more than my fair share
 of bad luck." he says glumly.

> But you're still alive.  They aren't.
