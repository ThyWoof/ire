"Not well, truth be told.  My recent quests have
 failed and I was forced to flee.  Men have taken
 to calling me "Ulric the Yellow".

 I have been on three quests lately, and all have
 ended terribly.  I have fought a dragon, gone in
 quest of treasure, and attempted to slay the foul
 liche in the nearby tower."

The man pales.

"Who has not heard of the Dragon of Lakeside?
 I am, I think, the only man who has confronted the beast
 and yet lived to speak of it.

 It was twice as long and twice the width of a cow, and
 had sharp teeth and claws.  The sharpest sword cannot
 piece its armour and it can summon up flames, not from
 its breath, but from the walls of the keep.

 Only by feigning death did I manage to escape the beast
 with my life."

Why did you attack the dragon?

[page="dragon2"]

"I went to try and slay it, to prove myself.
 It was a foolish deed.
 Since then I have stuck with smaller prey."

"In the depths of the forest, there is an area of dense
 woodland, that some call the Forbidden Forest.
 In it there lies a great pile of gold and jewels, but
 no man may approach it, for it is well-guarded.

 This treasure is guarded by five great Hell-Cats, with
 eyes like coals and claws like razors.  It is said that
 they will slay any man who comes too close to their prize."

"I journeyed to this spot, with twelve other men.
 We thought that by our numbers we could conquer the
 beasts, but it was not to be.  The largest cat rose as
 we approached and spoke to us in a harsh voice,
 warning us to leave immediately.

 Our leader ignored it, and we attacked.
 Our swords failed us, glancing off their gleaming hides,
 indeed, sword did even shatter on impact.  The hell-cats
 did become angry, and Within ten seconds, everyone else
 was dead, their throats torn out."

"I alone survived, for the beasts did not give chase when
 I threw down my sword and fled."

 "As adventurers go, I seem to have more than my fair share
  of bad luck," he adds glumly.

"In the northeast, there lies a fell tower.  Some say
 that it is home to an evil wizard, or even a daemon.
 Tales, there are, of a liche that guards a hoard of
 most fabulous treasure.
 But no-one knows for sure what evil lurks within,
 for the tower is guarded by deadly rabbits."

"Do not jest!  It is horrible!  When an intruder
 approaches the tower, the bunnies do swarm from their
 holes and attack every living thing.  They will
 overpower a man by sheer weight of numbers.

 Many moons ago I did journey there with four heroes,
 in quest to slay the beast that lurks within the tower
 and claim its treasures for our own.
 I saw them all die, the flesh stripped from their bones
 by the gnawing teeth.

 I alone survived by sacrificing my own feet, that the
 rest of me could escape.  It is fortunate indeed that
 Avis has an excellent healer."
