"My name is $NAME, and I am the healer of this town.

 As you may know, Avis is oft visited by many adventurers
 who seek to earn their gold by battling the fell beasts
 which the Evil One sends to devour our livestock and
 our farmers.

 But in battle there are always casualties, men mauled
 by beasts or set upon by brigands.  I tend to such
 casualties, and earn my own gold thereby.

 Sometimes heroes are slain, oftentimes if his patron be
 a wealthy shepherd, he may be brought to me for
 resurrection.  Of course this is never cheap."
