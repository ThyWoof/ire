"Aye, there are many such hawks in this village, for the
 lake provides fine eating for them.

 But there is one particular bird that perches outside my
 home.  I do not trust it, for it does watch me each day.

 The Church says that the Holy Ghost may appear as a bird
 and sometimes as a hawk or an eagle.  It maybe that the
 osprey visiting me is of the Trinity!

 But there are other things which it does too."

"I have seen the bird go to a nearby tree-stump, on which
 can be found a small, shiny cube.  Each face of the cube
 is covered in squares of different colours.

 One day, I saw the bird perching on the tree-stump and
 staring at the cube.  And as I watched, I saw the cube
 begin to split and revolve of its own accord!

 And when all this was done, the cube was changed, and
 each side of the cube had squares only of the same
 colour, when before they were mixed!

 And when this was done, the bird flew away!"

"Ross the Bewildered has not been seen much since he was
 sent to slay a dragon that lives to the west of our
 village.  But the dragon has not been seen much either.

 Some say that he defeated the beast but then died of a
 mortal wound in the attempt.  Others say that the Wyrm
 did merely eat him and is sleeping it away.

 But I have heard that Ross made a satanic pact with the
 dragon and serves it!"

 it looked like Ross!

 Whether or not this be so, the man was last seen heading
 to the dragon's keep, with the piglets and some fruit."

 This is expensive, I fear, but since the village of New

 my supplies from the distant realm of Lord O'Beth."
