"I make chainmail.  If you would like some, I will sell
 it for 200 gold coins.  If that is not sufficient, I
 also make fine platemail, but it requires skill to make
 and I must ask 600 gold coins.

 If you cannot afford plate, I also have some banded
 armour.  It is cheaper than the plate but more
 protective than the chain.  I will ask 300 gold.

 I also make shields, and I can sell one for 100 gold.
 You may wish to seek out Holm the fletcher.  He works
 wood and cloth, his wares may be more appropriate if you
 cannot afford the extra protection of steel."
