 This madman of a farmer has locked me up!
 I fear he means to murder me!"

"What kind of farmer just happens to have a dungeon
 in his cellar?!  How does that make sense?

 Please! People have been vanishing in Mawdor.
 I knew there was a farmer out here all on his own,
 so I went to warn him he may be in danger.
 
 Yet it seems he is the villain responsible!
 He intends to feed me to his cattle!"

 Mayhap he can't bring himself to slay a child, yet
 still he cannot risk my revealing his secret?
 Who knows the mind of a madman?"

 watched him force others in there... each time there
 was a scream and then silence!

 If you seek evidence, that is where I should look!"
