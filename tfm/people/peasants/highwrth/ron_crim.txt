 painted faces upon them.

 What people really wanted were the todestones.
 I still have some that I would gladly trade for bread."

"You get them by killing todes.  If the tode be old and
 big, the todestone shall be powerful, or so I hear.

 Wizards and mages use them in sorcery, and the Church
 use them too, for it is said that they glow when poison
 is near.  That is what most people want them for.

 I do not really know how to use them myself.

 If you bring me bread, I shall give you a handful of the
 stones."
