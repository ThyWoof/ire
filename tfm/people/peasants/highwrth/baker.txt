You see a large man in a cell, who seems to be in
fair spirit, despite his incarceration.

"I am the chief baker of this town.  For many years
 I have baked the finest bread.. I was apprentice
 to the King's personal cook.
 
 But the tithes of the Church have been my bane.
 I could afford no longer to make bread for the
 poorest, so I had to add chalk to the dough.

 I never thought I should need to do that, but
 the poor must have bread to eat, no matter how
 bad it may taste.
 This bread I sell cheaply to the poor, but I erred,
 for a batch was sold to the Church by mistake and
 I was jailed.
 
 But I do not despair, for my sentence was light.
 I shall be free in a year.."

"The tithes are hard.  It is difficult to pay the
 Church their due and have money left to eat with.

 But still, it is a small enough amount to secure
 a place in Heaven for your immortal soul.."

"We must pay the tithes.. our Lord demands it!
 If you try to cheat Him, He will know.

 Many have tried, and some have even succeeded
 but they shall all burn in Hell when they die..

 It is much easier to cheat the poor."

MOVE THIS TO THE CARDINALS!

"We must all pay the tithes, my $Son.
 For if you do not pay the tithes, you will have
 failed the Trinity.  The LORD judges us all when
 our time on this earth is ended, and those who
 disappoint our Father shall be sent to Hell.
 
 And those who OFTEN fail to pay shall have a
 particularly short time upon this earth!"
