"You should watch for snakes, bears, and woolves.
 They can be dangerous.  But do not attack them, even in
 self-defence.  The LORD cares for many of His creatures
 and is quick to anger if you harm them.

 There are also many birds and deer, which can be eaten.
 Greypigs will make a fine meal, but they can also be
 dangerous.
 
 Whatever you do, avoid the forest by night, for it is
 then that the imps and demons of the Evil One stalk the
 land!"

 maim or kill the unwary.  Dress thickly and the chances
 of being poisoned will diminish.

 There are also magical antidotes available that will
 cure most kinds of poisoning, so it is good to have some
 of these at hand.

 I have heard also of witches' spells that kill worms and
 snakes, but I know not how this be done."

"Aye, there are woolves that lurk in the forest, but
 throughout the Land there are three kinds of woolf.
 Some also say there is a fourth kind of woolf, called
 the lynx, but I have never seen one, and so can only
 tell you of the three kinds that I know.

 There are those which are hairy on the outside, they are
 the true woolves.  They eat our livestock, yet still they
 are God's creatures, sent by Him to test us, and save us
 from the sin of complacency."

 They could look like you or I, with but a few subtle
 differences.
 
 They are men, cursed by God and doomed to wander between
 the realms of man and beast, never able to settle in
 either one nor the other.

 But in the far east, in the realms of the Dark One lives
 a third kind of woolf.  In the mountains where the land
 meets the Great Desert, lie the dark woolves that
 worship Satan Himself!"

 can summon fire and brimstone to consume their foes!"

 I not much care for those.. little challenge in hunting
 them.  I do not hunt the black grouse, for it is

 them by Polak the Younger.  The Abbey at New Cricklade
 should have a copy.
