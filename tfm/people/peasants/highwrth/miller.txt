 flour, I must ask 25 gold coins.

 I realise this is a lot, but there is a shortage on.

 If you bring your own grain, I can mill it for you at a
 cost of only 3 gold coins, $MILORD."

 abandoned.  There is a terrible beast stalking the town
 and the miller is dead along with the rest of the town.

 It is said that they angered the Lord and the Beast was
 sent to punish them.

 In the mean time, there is but one mill to make flour,
 and that is mine."
