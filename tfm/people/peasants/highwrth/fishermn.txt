 Fish are like peas.. the more that you have, the more
 you need.

 Fish are also like enlightenment, for the more you seek
 them the harder they are to catch."

 Once I have eaten it, I shall be more wise than God!

 The only problem is that I have no idea what it looks
 like.  So I have decided to identify every fish in the
 world.  When I've finished, the only one which I don't
 recognise must be the one."
