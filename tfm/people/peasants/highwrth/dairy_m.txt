 pigs and certain of the calves I slay for their meats.

 This is done by my cousin, Ramirez, who is our butcher.
 He sells the meats at the market in town."

"Yea, the tithes are hard to pay, but we must.
 We have to find the money somehow, to keep the LORD
 pleased and save us from the fell enemies of mankind!

 In the past, I confess I was skeptical of the coming
 of the forces of darkness, and I believed, in my error,
 that it was but a ruse to open our purses to the Church.

 But now I have seen the evil with mine own eyes and I
 recant the errors of my youth.
 Without the tithes we will surely perish at the paws of
 the Evil One's fell children!"

"I saw the dark woolves of the East!

 I was travelling to Eastwarren, which is as far east as
 a man may dare to go.  It was approaching dusk, and I
 was hunting for grouse in the forest when I saw a light
 in the distance.

 It was a pair of dark woolves.  They were pushing a
 cart, and upon the cart was a lamp, and a keg of some
 fearsome devilry."

"For the greater glory of the LORD, I took it upon myself
 to slay these two fiends before they could work their
 mischief upon us.

 But when I took aim with my bow, one of the darkling
 creatures knocked the lamp over onto the keg and ran off
 into the night.  There was a sound like thunder and the
 cart was destroyed!

 I was fair knocked over by the force of the blast and
 could hear nothing until the morrow.

 Truly these creatures have unlocked the powers of
 Darkness to create such an evil weapon!"
