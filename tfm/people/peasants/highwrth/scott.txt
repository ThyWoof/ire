 too far into the forest and came across one of the
 Little People.

 He said he was hungry and asked me to give him a young
 hawk to roast, and I refused.

 The Little Man grew angry and said that if he could not

 Since that day not one egg has been laid to any of my

"I went to the Priests and the Bishops but they told me
 that the LORD is too busy to deal with my petty troubles.

 I prayed to God each night for many months that my hawks
 might again lay even one egg.  Upon the third eve of the
 new moon, I beheld a shining ball of light in my cabin!

 Choirs of angels did sing and the glory of the LORD
 filled the room, and then He spoke!

 The LORD told me to shut up and stop bothering Him, and
 He threatened to turn me inside out and send all my
 hawks to Hell if I disturbed Him again.

 And then the glory of God did shrink to the size of a
 pea and floated out through the window."
