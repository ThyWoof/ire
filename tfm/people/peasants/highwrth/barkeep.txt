"The Church has increased the Tithes again.  We will all
 have to work harder to pay the Church and keep our souls
 safe from the forces of darkness.

 There have been grim omens.  The black grouse of the
 woods did settle nearby and perform horrible acts of
 devilry at night!

 A bull gave birth to four pigs, and the Devil appeared
 before two men in the forest and spoke to them!

 And only the other day, Holm the Fletcher came across a
 terrible demon while gathering wood in the forests.
 It said it would eat him if he ever returned!"

"I once heard a tale of a Captain Skint, who it is said,
 bought many valuable spices and goods with his wealth,
 which all believe he did gain through crime and villany.

 They say that when the Church demanded their tithes, he
 fled with these goods and sailed away to a far distant
 isle, and burying most of it there did reduce his own
 tithings.  But things went ill for him and his ship
 did sink on the voyage home.  Some do say that it was a
 justice from God for his attempt to cheat the Trinity."
