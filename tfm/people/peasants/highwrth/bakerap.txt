"New Highworth was served by two mills, one in the north
 border, and another at New Fairford in the south.  Five
 years ago there was a disaster at the Fairford mill.

 The people there angered the Lord GOD, and a terrible
 beast in the form of a cow slew everyone in the town.
 The beast still roams free, and we cannot take back the
 mill, although the scouts say the mill itself is in good
 repair.

 If you could provide me with some flour, I would pay you
 for your trouble."
