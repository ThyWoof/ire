 Of late, this has become somewhat more difficult to
 achieve, for the lack of flour and now a dearth of
 fresh fish."

"There is but one fisherman in New Albion, and his mind
 has been clouded by the LORD.

 In days past I was able to purchase fresh fish from him
 at any time of year.  Now, it is difficult to speak with
 him at all.  I am forced to buy fish from travelling
 merchants of Scotia when they arrive, which is rare.

 I have not the time to seek them out myself.
 If however, you should find yourself in such lands, I
 would pay you well for any fish you could bring me."
