"I was walking through the woods late one day, and I
 became lost and I could not find myself any shelter
 before it came dark.
 
 As I was walking through the darkness, all of a sudden,
 the Devil himself appeared before me and tried to take
 me with him to Hell!
 
 But I recited the Saint Patrick's Breastplate, and he
 promised to release me if I could tell him a joke that
 he found suitably amusing."
