Martyn:	They had one of those little hanging baskets of flowers, you know,
	only they forgot to water them and they're just full of dead stalks..

Joe:	Sounds like mine.

Martyn:	I didn't know you had any.

Joe:	Yes, I had one of those once.  It was outside the door on my flat,
	full of dead plant.  It was like that when I got it.  I was going to
	take it down, then the gales came and it wasn't there in the morning.

Martyn:	How far did it go?

Joe:	I don't know... I haven't seen it since.
