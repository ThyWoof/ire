"As all know, there are three kinds of woolf.  There are
 the proper woolves, who patrol the world of beasts as
 the LORD decreed, there are the outcast woolf-men whom
 our LORD has cursed for their sins, and there are the
 black woolves of the East, who pay tribute to the
 Evil One.

 It is said that the evil black woolves never yawn, so if
 you do see a woolf and it yawns, you shall know that the
 woolf is a holy woolf."

"Nothing much has been heard from the Dragon of the North
 lately, though rumours say that a foolish man has sold
 his soul to the beast, and serves it!

 Jon the Apocather claims to have seen a number of
 dwarves singing, while he was out gathering hearbs.

 The village of New Leuchars has been destroyed by the
 forces of darkness.  The Church has increased the Tithes
 again as a result.

 And alas, some of our folk from this town have vanished.
 The Thane's men are baffled and suspect foul murder."
