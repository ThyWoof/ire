 I suppose that for a fee of 500 gold coins, I could

 you for higher teachings."

"Ah, but that's different.  He thinks that what we told
 him is a prophecy.  It's actually what we WANT the
 future to be like, and we're using him to make it come
 true.

 With all our powers directed on O'Beth, he'll easily
 usurp that fat-headed moron of a King, and then he'll
 pay.  Oh yes, we'll teach him to try and outlaw
 witchcraft!"

Myrtle poisoned Snow White (a waarg) because SW ate her cat
(SW: "I didn't know it was HERS!")
You can broker a deal between them, whereby SW sends the witch money to pay reparations
for eating the cat.
This will require a lot of travel so Myrtle should sell you spells and scrolls to run
the orb mark and recall spells.  She should have a spare orb or two in the cave, but
the only source for buying them is the Glassmaker.
She should tell you about the glassmaker, who used to live in Mordor but went south to
seek his fortune.

SW maybe doesn't have money?  Maybe she is only able to pay you in corpses, which
Myrtle is eager for for some reason?
Either way, Myrtle should reward you hansomely when you finish the quest.
