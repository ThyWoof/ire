You see an impressive-looking osprey, watching you with a
silent intent.  There is a strange gleam in the bird's
eyes.

Suddenly you hear a deep voice in your head.

"I am Pee-Chee-Phee-Khee of the Folk.

 Know that I am to bring you to our leader, who much
 desires to speak with you.

 But in this I am not without my price."

 early warning should they become hostile towards us.

 I have already identified their leader."

PCPK thinks Han is the leader because he provides meat for
the community
