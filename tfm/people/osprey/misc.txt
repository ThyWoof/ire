"One of your human poets wrote:

 'I will provide thee of a princely Osprey,
  That, as he flieth over fish in pools,
  The fish shall turn their glistening bellies up,
  And thou shall take thy liberal choice of all.'

 That kind of magic is easy to do."

Tell me about the end of the World

"As with all religions, we have our own belief about the
 end of the world.  These are from the sayings of the
 Prophet Ueii-Chee-Khii-Chii:

'There shall come a time when the great Iron Tree shall
 fall and be broken in pieces.

 The Dreaming God of the Thousand Years shall awaken and
 his rising will shake the foundations of the world.
 Kings shall be murdered, and men shall be slain!

 And, at the fifteenth hour, the fish shall rise!
 The fish shall rise from the waters, and seek vengance
 on all who would eat their kin!'"


That sounds like a crock of shit.

"Indeed.  There are some who believe that the prophecy was
 a divine message from the great Pee-Chee Bird, but it is
 widely known that the Prophet ate of the dreaming bushes.

 He was probably stoned out of his beak at the time."
