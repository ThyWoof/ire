 If it pleases you, you may call me the Wise Old Bird."

"Very well, I will tell you the history of the Folk.
 I have seen in the minds of others that we were animals
 introduced from the world that you call Earth.

 Since those days, we have changed.  We see into each
 others' minds, as I see into yours now.
 We do not know why we have changed."

"In the older days were were migratory creatures.
 We would fly to the southern continents to avoid the
 harsh winter, and the lack of fish it causes.

 To migrate, we followed the magnetic fields of the
 Earth.  But on this planet, we became lost and migration
 was not successful.

 When the Men found that we could not migrate, they would
 bring us fish in the winter.  One day, this stopped.
 Fortunately, we had learned much before this had
 happened.  We could already see each other's minds, and
 we had learned how to pickle fish for the winter."

"In the years leading up to this time, we noticed changes
 taking place in the minds of Men.

 They began to lose their reason, and primeval feelings
 rose up to replace intellect.  They became
 superstitious.  We did not realise what was happening.

 Soon men began to fight each other in the name of the
 New God.  All who did not worship were killed or driven
 away."

"There are a few men left who have clung to reason.
 We know that they have been watching us and suspect what
 we have become.  But we have decided not to make contact
 with them, until now.

 This is one of the reasons why we took it upon ourselves
 to capture a human specimen.  We needed to know if the
 time is right to announce ourselves to those who resist
 the New God."
