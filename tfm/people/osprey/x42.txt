"Hail, $PLAYER.  I am Chii-Chee-Pee-Khii.

 Know that you have great honour among our people.
 Long have we waited for the Unifying One!"

"The Unifying One was foretold by our leader.  Some
 claim that he saw the future in a sacred vision given
 him by the Pee-Chee bird, but most agree that he simply
 predicted the outcome of what was already known by the
 far-sighted ones.

 Our leader said that one would come and bring together
 the tribes of man, bird and beast against our common
 enemy."

"Our enemy is the one called Xy'Lan, for He wishes to
 enslave our people and use us as His tools.

 Some do say that He created us for this purpose.. to
 have the strong of our tribe to strike as His claws,
 and to have the farsighted as His looking-glass upon
 the future."

"Farsight is the name that we give to the visions of the
 future.  Not all can see such visions, but those who can
 are called 'the farsighted'.  Usually the gifted are
 weaker of body than their fellows.

 Some do say that the farsight is a gift given by the
 sacred Pee-Chee bird, but not all believe in this.
 Some say that the gift of farsight was given us by
 Xy'lan that we could serve Him.

 I do not know which to believe."

"Xy'Lan is greatly powerful, and He demands a tribute of
 worship from all thinking life.

 We do not trust Him, and we avoid doing His bidding
 where and when we can, but He is powerful and we fear to
 bring down His anger, for He could easily slay us all if
 He desired."

"I am the chief catcher.  I choose the waters that we
 shall hunt in, and direct those who catch the fish.

 I do fish myself, of course, but the others look to me
 for guidance.  I know where to catch the finest fisshh.

 Only the farsighted can see fish more accurately."

"Fish is very important!  It must be gathered in the
 summer and the spring and the autumn and it must be
 preserved.

 Fresh fish is not so easy to find in winter.
 The lakes freeze, and the fish hide away.."
