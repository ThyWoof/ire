 A dictionary you read when you were seven defines us
 as 'medium-sized falconiforme that feed almost
 exclusively upon fish'.

 Of course I have evolved far beyond the simple creatures
 in the dictionary, so to be honest, I'm not wholly sure.

 But that is unimportant."

##	Got fish
##


KKKC gives player chocolate biscuits
Player gives KKKC fish.
KKKC eats fish as below.
KKKC begins monologue about the Folk and the fall of humanity.
KKKC tells you that you must help him make contact with the aircraft.
KKKC joins your party and changes state so he can be picked up.
     He flies and so does not set off triggers.  You can either wield him or 
     have him as a separate party member.  If wielded need logic to prevent
     switching to KKKC if in pocket.

##	Got a fish.

$CHARNAME lands at your feet and drops a carrier bag
containing a sealed packet of chocolate biscuits.
He flies back onto his perch and waits.

You throw the fish into the air and $CHARNAME
deftly catches it.  Decapitating the fish, he eats the
head before speaking.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"First, I must tell you the history of the Folk.
 I have seen in the minds of others that we were animals
 introduced from the world you call Earth."

[colour="#808080"]
$CHARNAME pauses to gut the fish with his talons
before continuing.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Since those days, we have changed.  We see each others'
 minds, as I see into yours now.
 We do not know why we have changed."

[page="fish2"]

[colour="#808080"]
$CHARNAME slices the fish into fine strips and
begins to eat them one by one.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"In the older days were were migratory creatures.
 We would fly to the southern continents to avoid the
 harsh winter, and the lack of fish it causes."

"To migrate, we followed the magnetic fields of the
 Earth.  But on this planet, we became lost and migration
 was not successful."

"When the Men found that we could not migrate, they would
 bring us fish in the winter.  One day, this stopped."

[colour="#808080"]
Gulp!
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Fortunately, we had learned much before this had
 happened.  We could already see each other's minds, and
 we had learned how to pickle fish for the winter."

[colour="#808080"]
$CHARNAME eats another strip of fish.
[colour="#ffffff"]
"In the years leading up to this time, we noticed changes
 taking place in the minds of Men.
 They began to lose their reason, and primeval feelings
 rose up to replace intellect.  They became superstitious.
 We did not realise what was happening.

 Soon men began to fight each other in the name of the New
 God.  All who did not worship were killed or driven away.

 There are a few men left who have clung to reason.
 We know that they have been watching us and suspect what
 we have become.  But we have decided not to make contact
 with them, until now."

[colour="#808080"]
$CHARNAME eats the last strip of fish.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"That was a good fissh.

 Now I must ask for your aid.  There are some men left
 who do not worship the New God.  They have machines
 that fly and they know much.

 We want to make contact with them, but we need you to
 act as our emmisary.  I know that you have already
 made contact with them, so I only require that you
 carry out the necessary introductions."

 If you could help me, you will earn the eternal gratitude of the Folk."

"Many years ago, we were the simple creatures that
 arrived from Earth.

 But when we settled, something caused us to mutate, and
 we began to learn things, like how to preserve fish.

 When we began to hear each others' thoughts it became
 possible to merge into one large community, which we
 call the Folk."

[colour="#808080"]
The fishhawk's voice becomes more and more garbled as
you walk out of range.  You vaguely imagine the word
'Bustard!' before your thoughts are left alone.

In the distance, the large bird dives from the tree
stump and flies away.

 When we migrate, we use geomagnetic fields to guide us.
 The fields on this planet are different and cannot
 be used, so the urge to migrate has left us.

 Humans noticed this and brought us fish during the
 winter.  One year humans stopped doing this, but by then
 we had learned to stockpile food for the winter."
