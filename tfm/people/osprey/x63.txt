 If you can vouch for his good faith, he shall be freed.

$CHARNAME lands at your feet and drops a carrier bag
containing a sealed packet of chocolate biscuits.
He flies back onto his perch and waits.

You throw the fish into the air and $CHARNAME
deftly catches it.  Decapitating the fish, he eats the
head before speaking.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"First, I must tell you the history of the Folk.
 I have seen in the minds of others that we were animals
 introduced from the world you call Earth."

[colour="#808080"]
$CHARNAME pauses to gut the fish with his talons
before continuing.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Since those days, we have changed.  We see each others'
 minds, as I see into yours now.
 We do not know why we have changed."

[page="fish2"]

$CHARNAME slices the fish into fine strips and
begins to eat them one by one.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"In the older days were were migratory creatures.
 We would fly to the southern continents to avoid the
 harsh winter, and the lack of fish it causes."

"To migrate, we followed the magnetic fields of the
 Earth.  But on this planet, we became lost and migration
 was not successful."

"When the Men found that we could not migrate, they would
 bring us fish in the winter.  One day, this stopped."

[colour="#808080"]
Gulp!
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Fortunately, we had learned much before this had
 happened.  We could already see each other's minds, and
 we had learned how to pickle fish for the winter."

"In the years leading up to this time, we noticed changes
 taking place in the minds of Men.
 They began to lose their reason, and primeval feelings
 rose up to replace intellect.  They became superstitious.
 We did not realise what was happening.

 Soon men began to fight each other in the name of the New
 God.  All who did not worship were killed or driven away.

 There are a few men left who have clung to reason.
 We know that they have been watching us and suspect what
 we have become.  But we have decided not to make contact
 with them, until now."

$CHARNAME eats the last strip of fish.

"That was a good fissh.

 Now I must ask for your aid.  There are some men left
 who do not worship the New God.  They have machines
 that fly and they know much.

 We want to make contact with them, but we need you to
 act as our emmisary.  I know that you have already
 made contact with them, so I only require that you
 carry out the necessary introductions."
