 We don't get many human visitors around here, not since
 the Church set fire to the nearest village as
 punishment.  A very bad business, that."

"I originally came here to start a fish farm.. domestic
 and imported species.  It's quite a lucrative business,
 even given the tremendous costs of shipping fish
 interstellar.

 The war with the Church put paid to that idea, though,
 and I couldn't get the funding.  I ended up joining the
 wildlife survey team as the resident expert in marine
 biology."

"I was the one who did the flyover after we lost contact
 with our people there.  It was not a pretty sight.

 Most of the houses were still smoking.  There was a lot
 of blood, mostly darkened by the heat.  In the centre of
 the village was a message made out of bones and skulls
 from the murdered villagers.  It said "Jesus was 'ere".

 There was one survivor, a man called Father Abraham.
 He lives in our main office building now, if you want
 to talk to him."

"I'm fitted with an experimental repulsor system that
 allows me to hover for short periods of time, or do a
 vertical take-off/landing in some situations.

 I was able to land there, and the man threw himself
 before me, shouting 'Claim me, demon!   For I have
 failed the LORD!' or something of that nature.

 I had a passenger pod as well, since I was also sent
 there to locate any survivors.  So I picked him up and
 brought him home with me."
