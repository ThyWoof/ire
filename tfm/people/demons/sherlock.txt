"Elementary, my dear sir.

 I've known everyone else in this facility for more than
 twenty years.  You're not one of us, but you're not one
 of the Simple either.  You can't have come directly from
 Earth because there's a forcefield blocking all V-space
 warps larger than a pea.

 But we have detected an apparently uncontrolled burst of
 V-space activity inside the forcefield.  From the
 warp signature we found a source date BEFORE any
 commercial V-space activity.. it can only be Villani!

 So you must be Mr. Villani!"

"The 'Simple' was the term used by the Church to
 describe the uneducated in the Middle Ages.

 Since most of the population of Weytus now thinks it
 IS in the Middle Ages, it seemed the best word to
 describe the unfortunates who don't know better.

 I don't know who started using it."

 air with 100% accuracy.

 We also record aerial footage for the entertainment 
 industry.  There's still demand for air warfare films,
 although I'm sure I can't understand why.  Of course,
 if you've never been shot at by anti-aircraft missiles,
 you're likely to be a bit less biased."

"Our Master was a young entrepreneur who commissioned us
 from TL Aerospace.  He wanted a fleet of reconnaisance
 jets to cash in on the surveillance market.  We were the
 first two, and he named us 'Sherlock' and 'Watson'.

 When the Master died there were eight of us and we were
 each left with an equal stake in the company.
 But there was a slump in the market and some of the
 others lost interest anyway, or got better offers with
 larger firms.  Marple was accidentally shot down by her
 own employers, and retired to live off the compensation.
 Now it's just Watson and myself."

"On a colony world there is tremendous opportunity for a
 reconnaisance jet.  We can map the planet more
 accurately than the ship's scanner, and we're far cheaper
 than the satellite grid you'd need to get that level of
 detail around the whole globe.  They would also have to
 be geosynchronous, which means you have to wait for the
 satellite to pass over the bit of interest.

 Also we can use thermal imaging and other pods to
 monitor wildlife, which is what we were doing until the
 invasion.  Now we're doing military work again.
 Emergency military rates are always good, assuming we
 live to collect.  I don't trust the Church to honour
