 Servitor of the Old Gods of the Forest..

 I hear the whispered words of the trees..
 Such ancient secrets they sing!"

 The icy caress of night entwines the eon-veiled obsidian
 tower..

 The whispering of ancient tongues are borne upon the
 winds..

 Dark time-lost spells hold the key to the frost-veiled
 gates of the Black Moon!"

 Void did disgorge the dwellers-in-eternal-shadow.

 And upon a horde of winged horrors, brandishing swords
 of ebon flame, they rode out from the Gate.

 And a terrible silence fell upon Kor-Avul-Thaa."

 the planet.  Or at least, I used to.

 I haven't been given much to do recently, and I guess
 that's a good thing, since the Papists have been taking
 pot shots at us.

 I hear they've managed to get poor old Randolph.

 So, without any missions, it gets a bit dull.
 But it's better than dying."
