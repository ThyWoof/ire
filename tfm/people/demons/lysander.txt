You see a hawk light fighter, with a green stripe on
their tailfin.  The hawk looks at you with interest, and
speaks in a female voice.

"I'm one of the wildlife aircraft.  I was doing
 industrial espionage and reconnaisance in my previous
 job, and it didn't appeal to me.  So I quit and
 found a more ethical job on Weytus instead.  Milo came
 with me, of course.

 I really wanted a wildlife job.. I like animals a lot."

She looks very concerned.

"He's from the nearby town.. or what's left of it.

 Something very terrible happened there and he's the only
 survivor we know of, so we took him in.

 He needs help and he doesn't appear to be violent, and
 anyway, it seemed the humanitarian thing to do.

 Poor guy, he's really confused."

"The details are sketchy.  I guess you should really ask
 the monk himself, if he'll talk about it.

 But from what I understand, it seems that Jesus Christ
 appeared in the village and started killing everyone.

 In the first book of Corinthians, it says that the
 living cannot enter the Kingdom of God.

 Maybe He was sending the village to Heaven.."

"The ospreys started to behave strangely some years ago.
 When we investigated this, a paranormal security breach
 occurred and one of the birds escaped.

 After it happened, the ospreys flocked to the lake where
 they are now residing.  They built a village from trees
 a bit like Venice.

 The village is to the west, but they don't like
 intruders, and shoot at them.  It's dangerous to go near
 there!"

"I wish it was, sometimes.  Life would be so much easier
 if we didn't have to worry about psionic birds of prey.

 But the plain fact is, we don't know how smart they are,
 and that scares me.

 Someone from the village said he once saw an osprey
 solving a rubik's cube.

 Take a look at the project report, it's in the office."

"Oh, all right.

 We fitted all the birds with satellite transmitters,
 little black boxes attached to their legs.  We have to
 recharge them every seven years.

 One day, about fifteen years ago, we found one of the
 birds was acting funny.  We thought he was just stupid
 at first, but one day we found him very sick.

 We took him in for study, but some of the other birds
 were starting to get sick as well."

"We took an EEG reading of his brainwaves and that was
 when things started to get out of hand.  They weren't
 just normal brainwaves, you see.  There was binary data
 and sinewaves and all kinds of bad stuff.

 Austin said we should try summing all the sinewaves up
 and we got an audio signal.. audio.. straight from the
 osprey's brain!

 We put it through Lucent's beatbox and there was this
 voice, saying things out of the bible and talking about
 destroying mankind and stuff.  It was very scary."

"When the voice finished, our bird recovered and we let
 him go again, it was like nothing ever happened.

 Five years later, we needed to recharge the transmitter
 so we recaptured him.  It was surprisingly difficult,
 we had to stun him because he kept escaping.

 We took the opportunity to do a complete physical
 examination and left him in an aviary overnight."

"In the morning, we found he was gone and the wire fence
 was melted to slag.  When we looked at the satellite,
 we found all the birds had stopped moving!

 So we sent a team out to investigate, and they found
 dozens of the little black transmitters, all lying in the
 grass.  One of them had been opened, and it belonged to
 the bird that we'd taken."

"Back at base, the results from the bird came in and we
 found that his bones had turned to carbon-composites.
 When we discovered from the blood sample that he has two
 extra pairs of chromosomes all hell broke loose.

 In the rush to sequence it they hooked up all the
 computing power they could get, including our brains.
 That was a week that really, really, really sucked!

 When my husband was well enough to fly again, he went to
 try and and locate them, he came back with some really
 amazing footage of ospreys building a village!"

"That sounds like the ring that our master found in
 New Leuchars.  Interesting little thing.. if you put it
 on your finger, you become invisible.  It even works on
 aircraft.

 If the Doctor had taken it with him, the ospreys might
 not have caught him, but I gather he was rather afraid
 to use it, in case he ended up eating fish in a cave
 for the next five hundred years.

 We really wanted to find out how it worked, but we don't
 have the right equipment.  I'm sure the guys at Fairford
 could do something with it, though.

 The ring is probably still in Dr. Robertson's study."

"Why should the ospreys be different?  What is so special
 about them that should make them become so intelligent?
 The humans haven't.

 Let's think about this.. what is different?

 Fish!  Ospreys eat fish, and practically nothing else.
 Do you think you could bring us a a fish so that we can
 examine it for clues?"

"There's.. something.. there, but we don't know what it
 is.  I can tell you it's not wholly organic.  Most of
 our equipment is for tissue and biochemistry analysis..
 this is going to require some hard materials science.

 I think you should ask the Intelligence team to perform
 an analysis of the fish.  Talk to Fisher if you can, she
 has more experience with this kind of thing."
