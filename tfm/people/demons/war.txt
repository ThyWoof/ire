A polished black aircraft watches you with large, red
eyes.  Finally he speaks in a soft, quiet voice.

"Hello there, human.  Welcome to the Security base.

 I'm one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, I just
 happen to be the one called 'Pestillence'.  Don't let
 the name put you off."

"Oh yes, we can be repaired, it just takes a long time.
 The alloy can be pierced if it's exposed to just the
 right wavelength of radiation for about three days.

 There are weaker joins to the armour so it can be
 removed in sections to allow access to my internal
 systems.  That way, I can be opened up for maintenance
 in a properly-equipped workshop, but still be
 invulnerable in a combat situation."

"I can defeat dozens of lesser aircraft in air-to-air
 combat.  That would be mean, though."

Pestillence sighs.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"I kill people and stuff.  I did't ASK to be one of the
 four horsemen, it's just my lot in life.
 I can't help it.. I have to serve my master, even if it
 means doing evil things from time to time.

 I don't have to ENJOY it, like Death does."

Death

"He's pretty far gone.. it's scary.

 I'm afraid he's going to kill somebody one of these
 days.  He's got to be rebalanced, but I fear that's only
 going to happen after he's murdered one of the ground
 crew, or a passer-by or something.  Yeech."

"He's very professional, like Famine.  Tries not to think
 too hard about who he's killing.

 I don't think he enjoys his job much either, but he
 tries hard to conceal that, and convince himself that
 he's on the side of the angels, as it were.

 He's a good comrade, and can be fun when he's off-duty."

[page="famine"]
[image="f16v2.pcx"]

"I like Famine.  I think he's got just the right balance
 between me and Death.  Nobility, a good sense of loyalty
 but enough justice to refuse illegal orders.

 Having said that, I think that nobility and honour are
 very overrated, at least for us.  I mean, risking your
 life for your country is a pretty hollow gesture if you
 can't die.

 But I'm rambling.  Basically, I think that Famine
 represents everything I can never really be myself."

Why don't you resign

[page="resign"]

"Oh yeah, I'd love to just turn round and tell my Master
 to go .... himself.  But I can't do that while we four
 are the last line of defence against a mad god.

 I just can't shirk that kind of responsibility."

"What I'd really like to do is become a FireFighter, and
 do some actual good, not just killing people that my
 Master happens to dislike on that particular week.

 The uniform's nice, too."
