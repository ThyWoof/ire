 It was, supposedly, a man made from brass that could

 superior to the Android, if it ever really existed.

 But instead of being built in the shape of a man, I was
 made in the form of a, uh.. 'flying chariot'.  My chores
 are to fly to places for my Master.  I can carry goods
 to remote places very quickly.

 But mostly I am sent as a scout, to watch things from

This
 Is How
  It Might
   Have Been
    Once

"I.. I don't like to remember this, but I'll tell you
 what happened.  You can make your report to Ransome if
 he is so eager to hear it."

"I took off from the carrier Zebreznek on a routine
 surveillance flight, when I saw a group of oddly-dressed
 humans.

 One of them was dressed in pale robes and carrying a
 large Bible.   He pointed at a tree and it was struck by
 lightning.  Then he pointed at me.."

"..the last thing I remember was the pain, as one of my
 wings was torn off and my skull was shattered by the
 impact.  After that I was back at base.. "
