"I come from Falconsgrave, in Utah.

 It's a small military installation by the salt lakes.
 They named it Falconsgrave in honour of the unborn.  In
 older days, when humans cared little for our kind, a
 number of F-16s crashed into the lake.  Many of these
 were never recovered and the lake has become a tomb for
 those who were lost to use before they could be made
 sentient."
