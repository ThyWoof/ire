"I was like you once.. a human.

 But my body was dying of an incurable disease, so I
 joined the air force.  My brain was attached to a
 specially designed life-support system in this airframe.

 It was a new lease of life for me.

 But that was many many decades ago, and as my brain aged
 it began to wear out.  Gradually my entire cortex was
 replaced with cybernetic components.  But I believe I am
 still the same person."



"It sucked.  The other fighters wouldn't let me join them
 in front-line roles because I could die permanently, even
 though I was not afraid to risk my only life.

 They kept being overprotective like that until I was
 almost entirely cybernetic."
