"F-18 is much easier to pronounce."




"It varies amongst us.  A delicate balance has to be kept.

 Too aggressive and you'll get an aircraft that is a
 borderline psychotic.  It's not great... they often kill
 people at the slightest provocation.

 It's very difficult to treat as well.  Sometimes the only
 cure is to replace the brain circuitry and re-download.
 That will get you a nervous wreck of an aircraft, but a
 harmless one."

"At the other end of the scale, you'll get pacifism and a
 total refusal to fight.  They are often paranoid and are
 constantly worrying about conflict or injury.  Of course,
 there's no problem employing most of these cases in
 non-combative roles.  They are often very good at
 intelligence work, if you can persuade them that the
 danger to their own lives is minimal."

"Besides, even the most extreme pacifist can be made to
 fight in an emergency.  Every aircraft has some cause
 they would risk their lives for, it's just a matter of
 finding it.  It's not hard to persuade aircraft to
 fight a direct threat to their country.  But launching
 an attack, now that's hard.  You need to promote
 aggression, with all the problems that brings.
 Indoctrination and neural circuit modification are the
 two most common techniques to get attack aircraft.
 The modifications are highly illegal."

"The difficulty involved getting aircraft to invade
 other countries has helped keep Earth relatively free of
 war for a long time.

 Sometimes an aircraft will change from aggressive to
 pacifistic as the result of a massive psychic shock,
 usually when an aircraft realises that they have
 been committing atrocities for their Master.
 Austin on the intelligence team, he's like that.
 Poor guy."

"I and my team are most carefully balanced.  We recognise
 of the necessity to defend our country whatever the risk
 and we are willing to sacrifice our lives for such a
 cause.  We are prepared to engage our enemies, but only
 as a last resort.  We will not kill an enemy aircraft
 without a parley unless they pose an intolerable threat.

 The Horsemen, they're special.  Death in particular, he's
 borderline psychotic."

[colour="#ffffff"]

"Gentlemen, gentlemen.. Xy'lan waits for no-one.  
 We must first discuss the plan, then you may talk as
 you will.

 As I suppose you are aware, it was our race that created
 the mad god, so it is therefore our responsibility to
 un-create Him.  But we lack the resources to manage this
 on our own.

 I have therefore decided to place our knowledge and
 skill at your disposal, that we may be able do together
 what cannot be done alone."

"I believe first task should be to negate the force
 barriers preventing transport between your bases.

 We have a plan to do this by temporarily reprogramming
 the drives in our ship, the Maxima, which lies buried
 beneath the temple built by the human known as 'Pope'.

 Our chief engineer believes they can could make the
 drives generate a pulse of energy attuned to the force
 barrier.  Negating it by phase cancellation is one
 possibility, but Xy'Lan could re-instate the barrier
 simply by having his repair servitors deactivate the
 engines."

[nextpage="comms_active5"]
[endpage]


[page="comms_active5"]
[image="comms.pcx"]

"However, a pulse in tune with the barrier should create
 a resonance that would burn out the field generators.
 I cannot promise that this will be a permanent fix,
 but with luck it will buy us the time we need to regain
 control of the ship, and defeat Xy'Lan.

 If we can avoid having someone enter the ship itself,
 that would be best as it is the very seat of Xy'Lan's
 power and He will do His best to prevent intrusion so
 close to his prize.

 However, we will definitely need to send someone to the
 temple to explore its underworks.  There is probably
 some kind of workshop below where Pope can access the
 systems himself when Xy'Lan needs him to."
