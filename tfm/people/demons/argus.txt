Commander Argus hasn't been written yet

TODO: Argus at the very least should mention the interstellar
transmitter and why they have a security base anyway

[page="fa18"]

"F-18 is much easier to pronounce."




"It varies amongst us.  A delicate balance has to be kept.

 Too aggressive and you'll get an aircraft that is a
 borderline psychotic.  Israel had a lot of those and
 they would often kill people at the slightest provocation.

 It's very difficult to treat as well.  Sometimes the only
 cure is to replace the brain circuitry and re-download.
 That will get you a nervous wreck of an aircraft, but a
 harmless one."

"At the other end of the scale, you'll get pacifism and a
 total refusal to fight.  They are often paranoid and are
 constantly worrying about conflict or injury.  Of course,
 there's no problem employing most of these cases in
 non-combative roles.  They are often very good at
 intelligence work, if you can persuade them that the
 danger to their own lives is minimal."

"Besides, even the most extreme pacifist can be made to
 fight in an emergency.  Every aircraft has some cause
 they would risk their lives for, it's just a matter of
 finding it.  It's not hard to persuade aircraft to
 fight a direct threat to their country.  But launching
 an attack, now that's hard.  You need to promote
 aggression, with all the problems that brings.
 Indoctrination and neural circuit modification are the
 two most common techniques to get attack aircraft.
 The modifications are highly illegal."

"The difficulty involved getting aircraft to invade
 other countries has helped keep Earth relatively free of
 war for a long time.

 Sometimes an aircraft will change from aggressive to
 pacifistic as the result of a massive psychic shock,
 usually when an aircraft realises that they have
 been committing atrocities for their Master.
 Austin on the intelligence team, he's like that.
 Poor guy."

"I and my team are most carefully balanced.  We recognise
 of the necessity to defend our country whatever the risk
 and we are willing to sacrifice our lives for such a
 cause.  We are prepared to engage our enemies, but only
 as a last resort.  We will not kill an enemy aircraft
 without a parley unless they pose an intolerable threat.

 The Horsemen, they're special.  Death in particular, he's
 borderline psychotic."

The comms unit flickers into life and the Commander
almost drops it.
Commander Gurd appears, looking rather displeased.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"So?  So what if we still use valves?  What's it to you?
 Could YOU design a transistor circuit capable of
 amplifying 130 amps at 15'000 volts?"

"Anyway.  I am commander Gurd of the Drakaan research
 team, and I wish to propose an alliance against Xy'lan,
 who the humans worship as a god.

 As a token of our good faith, I have sent you this
 communications device of our own design, which will not
 be affected by Xy'lan's jamming signals.

 Once these devices have been given to all three of your
 bases, you will again be able to talk to your comrades.
 And, once all are in contact, we can then discuss my
 proposals in more detail."

 while that barrier is still up.  Any thoughts on that?"

"They will have to be hand-delivered, unfortunately.
 We will probably not be able to remove the barrier

[colour="#ffffff"]

"Well, I guess'd better deliver the other units.
 Not a task I envy, I have to say.  The other bases
 are New Fairford to the west, and the wildlife research
 facility at New Leuchars, northwest of here.

 Feel free to refresh yourself in the base facility if
 before you head out, though.  Best of luck."

As all the comms units are linked together, there is a
tremendous babel of voices as the three base commanders
attempt to catch up on decades worth of news.

Eventually, Gurd butts in and calls the meeting to order.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Gentlemen, gentlemen.. Xy'lan waits for no-one.  
 We must first discuss the plan, then you may talk as
 you will.

 As I suppose you are aware, it was our race that created
 the mad god, so it is therefore our responsibility to
 un-create Him.  But we lack the resources to manage this
 on our own.

 I have therefore decided to place our knowledge and
 skill at your disposal, that we may be able do together
 what cannot be done alone."
