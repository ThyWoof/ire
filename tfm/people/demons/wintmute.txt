Wintermute


(If carrying weapons)
"No!  Don't shoot!"


Wintermute is somewhat pacifistic.  He's a hacker, and
not a combat aircraft.
He has been a combat aircraft in the past an still bears
mental scars.  He was a front-line fighter who deserted
and tried to defect to the US side.  But they panicked
and opened fire on him.  Wintermute sustained serious
cannon wounds and was shot half to death before he could
convince the Americans that he wanted to defect.

He spent the rest of the war as a cripple in a detention camp.
