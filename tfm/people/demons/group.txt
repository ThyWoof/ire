"If MY steel gets bloodied, that means someone
 got in the way while I was landing."

<austin, look annoyed>

"I must agree that action is needed.

 But I want you to know that I find your desire to
 kill other humans sickening."

"We are aircraft; We do not just go around killing
 people.  If there is to be any violence, it must
 be done in a politically correct manner.
 
 We need a name to call what we are about to do."

<'Bob.'
 "Yeah!  Let's go and Bob the Pope!
  And since you thought of the name, YOU can go do it!".>
 
<'Downsizing.'
 Possibly.. but I'm still not sure..>

<Austin:
 If there must be killing, we should not delude ourselves
 or try to hide behind names.  It must be done as quickly
 and as cleanly as the circumstances allow.>

"No.  All the colonists went through psychometric
 testing to judge that they were suitable.

 At the time he arrived on planet, Harris was NOT
 likely to go off on a bender!

 He must have found something on the planet.."

Player: I've decided to abandon you all and serve the LORD.

De Luca: What?!?

Player: I'm going to merge with Xy'lan.  I shall become a God!

Death:  Please let me kill him!

Ransome: Villani!  Think what you are doing.. No good can come of this!
         Xy'lan will destroy you!

Austin: That settles it.  We should surrender immediately!
        Mr. Villani, when you become one with Christ or whatever, can
	you put in a good word for us?  Do you think?
	We're all really sorry and quite happy to serve Xy'lan in a
	peacetime role..
