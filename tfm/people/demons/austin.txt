 But because all the left and centre movements had left
 Old Israel, it was now dominated by the right-wing and
 the Ultra-orthodox.  They considered it blasphemous for
 their country to be called Israel and changed the name
 to 'New Zion'.

 Then they declared war on virtually all their neighbours

 success has been negligible."

"It seems incredible that I did all this, doesn't it?

 They had conditioned us to obey without question, so I
 simply accepted that the target was a terrorist base and
 attacked it with napalm.  It was my job, and the
 terrorists posed a direct threat to the country I had
 pledged to give my life to defend if need be.

 I was awarded a medal for that attack, you know, and I
 accepted it, although I had a faint uneasiness about the
 whole thing.  When we were given a direct order to fire
 on civilians, my squadron defected to Jordan instead."

"Only then did we learn that the 'terrorist base' I had
 had attacked was actually a school.  I returned to my
 hangar without a word and shot myself in the head to try
 and atone for my crimes.

 When I committed suicide, it also destroyed a number of
 illegal modifications that the military had made to my
 brain to promote aggressive behaviour.  The 'me' who had
 killed all those children died that day."

"Even so, it took the finest in Jordanian psychology to
 convince me that I was not truly responsible for my
 actions and get me relatively sane again.
 
 The trauma for all of us was very severe.. it is unlikely
 any members of my squadron will ever see action again.
 But that's probably for the best.  There are many
