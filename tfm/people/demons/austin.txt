 Most of them are about as smart as a clever dog, except

 They're very honest and loyal, but if you've seen their

 get working!

 We did make some.  We were going to deliver them to the
 other bases by hand, but our couriers kept disappearing.
 We think the Church got them, poor guys...

 Of course, we can't airdrop them either, owing to the
 flight barriers that cut us off from the other bases.
 The Church has really got us locked down tight."
