"Gentlemen, gentlemen.. Xy'lan waits for no-one.
 We must first discuss the plan, then you may talk as
 you will.

 As I suppose you are aware, it was our race that created
 the mad god, so it is therefore our responsibility to
 un-create Him.  But we lack the resources to manage this
 on our own.

 I have therefore decided to place our knowledge and

"I believe first task should be to negate the force
 barriers preventing transport between your bases.

 We have a plan to do this by temporarily reprogramming
 the drives in our ship, the Maxima, which lies buried
 beneath the temple built by the human known as 'Pope'.

 Our chief engineer believes they can could make the
 drives generate a pulse of energy attuned to the force
 barrier.  Negating it by phase cancellation is one
 possibility, but Xy'Lan could re-instate the barrier
 simply by having his repair servitors deactivate the
 engines."

[nextpage="comms_active5"]

[page="comms_active5"]

"However, a pulse in tune with the barrier should create
 a resonance that would burn out the field generators.
 I cannot promise that this will be a permanent fix,
 but with luck it will buy us the time we need to regain
 control of the ship, and defeat Xy'Lan.

 If we can avoid having someone enter the ship itself,
 that would be best as it is the very seat of Xy'Lan's
 power and He will do His best to prevent intrusion so
 close to his prize.

 However, we will definitely need to send someone to the
 temple to explore its underworks.  There is probably
 some kind of workshop below where Pope can access the
 systems himself when Xy'Lan needs him to."

"Many reasons.  Firstly, there was a crackdown on digital

 Vinyl and analogue tape became the only permitted media.
 Even after the ban, many people found they preferred the
 sound of analogue.

 We use optical playback systems so the records do not
 deteriorate.. the disks last a lot longer than uh,
 what were they called..?  Oh yeah, CDs.

 Apart from the fact that the artwork is better, most
 aircraft prefer vinyl because it's easier to hold than
 a pea-sized data card."

[page="mediaban"]

"Many digital devices were banned, citing terrorism or
 some other transparent lie.. didn't really matter what
 because it was easy to buy legislation at that time.

 The new laws were so broad and strict that they outlawed
 the digital recorders, reverb units and synthesizers
 that actually produced the music.  It took years to get
 the law overturned and caused a stock crash that
 bankrupted most of the media corporations.

 In the meantime, music had to be recorded using 1975
 technology.  Laid down on 24-track, with all-analogue
 effects and no sampling.  Even tape sync was illegal.

 Some say the resulting barrier-to-entry vastly improved
 the quality of the music released during that period."

"Oh, I see.  You mean, why don't I have a futuristic body
 NOW?  It's mostly down to looks and appearance.

 You're probably thinking that I should have a squat,
 angular body like, perhaps, an F-117 so that I can be
 radar-invisible?

 Technology has advanced quite a lot.  We can add photonic
 tunnelling to any aircraft, and that achieves total
 invisibility.  That's better than the F-117 ever had and
 you can have a stylish body into the bargain."

"There are also trendier versions of existing designs,
 for example the F16-7000 series, usually referred to as
 the 'superfalcon' has sculpted bodywork, and a sportier
 look.

 There are one or two experimental designs, but most of
 us prefer the late 20th century look."

"I mentioned earlier that some people can hear the voice
 of God.  I can't, because it seems that whatever is
 broadcasting this voice is aimed only at humans.

 But over the last month or so it seems that this voice of
 God, or whatever it is, has announced that the LORD will
 lead His people to Ethiopia, to recapture the Garden of
 Eden from the Infidel.

 It is only yesterday that we finally worked out what
 that means.  Pope Harris is going to send all his 
 followers out to invade this  'Garden of Eden', and
 that can only mean one place.  Earth."

 We had a horror night at the academy drive-in, you see.
 Top Gun.. Independence Day..  Iron Eagle..
 Horrible stuff!  I left early.
 
 It didn't stop me from checking out Legend, though.
 A far better Tom Cruise film."
