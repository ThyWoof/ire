 So far I've sacrificed two cows and a toad, with not
 very much to show for it.

 The toad was quite interesting, though.  Inside the
 skull I found a crystal of some kind that shouldn't
 be there.  It was exhibiting some quite unusual quantum
 phenomena, but it gradually faded after the toad died.
 
 Some Church texts I've read describe a jewel called a
 'todestone', and I think I've found one."

 My toad was found by the guards.  It was lurking outside
 the base, and as far as I know it was the only one.

 I understand there are swamps in the forest, you should
 be able to find one there.  Or you might try following
 the rivers and streams.

 Be careful when you find one, they are quite dangerous.
 If you can stun it, or drug it to sleep somehow, that
 could save you many burns."

Fisher takes the toad carefully and, after administering

watch.

claimed to be the property of Satan and babbled about
crucifixion in a flat toneless voice, Fisher turns towards
you holding the now silent toad and looking rather happy.

"I knew watching ZARDOZ was gonna help!

 See, this toad has a crystal implanted in its skull,
 presumably by Pope Harris or his cronies.

 Around the crystal, there's a faint distortion of
 reality at the quantum level, which enables the toad
 to shoot fireballs and project a voice.

 We also think it's allowing the toad to be controlled
 remotely."

"Now.  This is just a guess, but I THINK the toadstone
 is acting as a focal point to concentrate the magical
 power onto the toad.  We're not quite sure of the
 mechanism yet.

 But, Fisher thinks that if YOU have one of these
 crystals, you might be able to cast spells yourself!

 But it doesn't look like the crystal lattice is very
 stable outside of the toad.  I expect the stone will
 break down after heavy usage."

 To be perfectly frank, I don't know.  But from what I
 do know, or have guessed, something very scary has
 happened!

 You can guess the panic when we found that huge
 buildings were being put up overnight.

 At first, I thought that WE had been put into stasis.
 That would have been horrible!  All the humans we know

 As near as I can guess, the Pope has somehow speed up
 the rate of time for SOME places, but not others.
 For the areas affected, a year seems to have passed for
 each day that went by.
 The effect lasted for exactly one year, then stopped.

 And that brings me to another point."

 Or to put it another way, Pope Harris has slowed down
 the rotation of the planet, apparently on a whim.
