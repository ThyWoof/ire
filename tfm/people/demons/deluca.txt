A large jet fighter stands impressively before you, the
painted bodywork shimmering like the coat of some
fabulous steed.  Each of the two tail fins bears a green
emblem.

Suddenly two yellow eyes open in the canopy and the
creature addresses you in a female voice.

 I am a Sukhoi-2700, descended from the Su-27 design of
 the ancients.  In bygone days, my kind were referred to
 as 'Flankers', I think.

 I'm not really sure what that meant, but I suspect it was
 some kind of military codename."
