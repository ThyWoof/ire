 I can.

 The ospreys have become intelligent.  We don't know how,
 and we don't know what they want.

 We do know that they posess superhuman powers, and
 they've built some kind of village."

 I suggest you check out the project report.  There's
 a copy of it in the main offices.

 The village is to the north-northwest of here, but be
 very careful!
 The birds don't like intruders, and they can zap you.

 Lysander can also give you more information."

"The ospreys started to behave strangely some years ago.
 When we investigated this, a paranormal security breach
 occurred and one of the birds escaped.

 After it happened, the ospreys flocked to the lake where
 they are now residing.  They built a village from trees
 a bit like Venice.

 The village is to the north, but they don't like
 intruders, and shoot at them.  It's dangerous to go near
 there!"

"I wish it was, sometimes.  Life would be so much easier
 if we didn't have to worry about psionic birds of prey.

 But the plain fact is, we don't know how smart they are,
 and that scares me.

 Someone from the village said he once saw an osprey
 solving a rubik's cube."

"We fitted all the birds with satellite transmitters,
 little black boxes attached to their legs.  We have to
 recharge them every seven years.

 One day, we found one of the birds was acting funny.
 We thought he was stupid at first, but one day we found
 him very sick.  We took him in for study, but some of
 the other birds were starting to get sick as well.

 We took an EEG reading of his brainwaves and that was
 when things started to get out of hand.  They weren't
 just normal brainwaves, you see.  There was binary data
 and sinewaves and all kinds of stuff."

"Austin said we should try summing them and we got an
 audio signal.. audio.. from the osprey's brain!

 We put it through a stereo and there was this voice,
 saying things out of the bible and talking about
 destroying mankind and stuff.  It was very scary.

 When the voice finished, our bird recovered and we let
 him go again, it was like nothing ever happened.

 Five years later, we needed to recharge the transmitter
 so we recaptured him.  It was surprisingly difficult,
 we had to stun him because he kept escaping."

"We took the opportunity to do a complete physical
 examination and left him in an aviary overnight.

 In the morning, we found he was gone and the wire fence
 was melted to slag.  When we looked at the satellite,
 we found all the birds had stopped moving!

 So we sent a team out to investigate, and they found
 dozens of the little black transmitters, all lying in the
 grass.  One of them had been opened, and it belonged to
 the bird that we'd taken."

"Back at base, the results from the bird came in and we
 found that his bones had turned to carbon-composites.
 When we discovered from the blood sample that he has two
 extra pairs of chromosomes all hell broke loose.

 In the rush to sequence it they hooked up all the
 computing power they could get, including our brains.
 That was a week that really, really, really SUCKED!

 When my husband was well enough to fly again, he went to
 try and and locate them, he came back with some really
 amazing footage of ospreys building a village!"
