"I rule Avis, reporting to his majesty, King Edwyg.
 We are but a small farming community, so there is usually
 little trouble.

 However, the town is popular with adventurers come to seek
 their fortune.  Some do cause trouble and must be dealt with."

"We are a small farming community.  Lately monsters have been coming from
 the caves in the north, devouring our livestock and sometimes our citizens.
 Bandits attacks have been increasing of late, possibly because the tithings
 have increased again."

"The tithes are a fee which we must pay the LORD and his assistants
 on this world.  He has done so much for us, it is only fair that we
 show Him our appreciation in this way.

 However, it does cause problems for those who are less able to pay."

"There are a number of fell thieves in the woods, stealing sheep and
 waylaying travellers.  Several traders have gone missing, and we
 suspect foul murder.

"To this end, the King has authorised a bounty for their execution.
 If you bring to me their heads as proof, I shall pay you 250 gold coins
 for each bandit slain."

"They come from the mountains to the north, slaying our animals and
 sometimes our men.

 It may be that we can find a mage to seal off the cave by our fields,
 for that should reduce their number such that our adventurers can
 see off the rest.  Though the Church does not approve of such things."
