"Four score and ten years ago, the LORD placed a curse
 upon this land, and it remains barren unto this day.
 
 It was referred to by many as 'Mawdor' referring to the
 fabled land of darkness and evil.  That name has stuck.
 
 But soon I shall rule over more pleasant lands."

He chuckles slightly.

"My domain is officially known as the Northlands but
 after the land was made barren by the LORD, it became
 known in jest as Mawdor, after the fabled land of
 darkness and evil.  That name has stuck.
 
 How I long to rule over more pleasant lands.."

"This dark and barren land is the least favourite place
 of all the King's realm.  He was in need of someone to
 rule this dread place on his behalf.
 
 I am quite sure that the King longed to be rid of me.
 No doubt it pleased him that the one problem should
 solve the other..  But not for long.

 Soon, I shall march against King Duncan the Foolish and
 usurp his throne!  With the King dead, I shall take the
 Golden Round for my own, and all Scotia shall be mine.."

"Ross?  He was sent away on a quest by King Duncan, to a
 castle on an island in the far northwest peninsula.

 His errand was to slay the dragon which has taken
 residence in those derelict halls, and to rescue the
 fair maiden held captive there.
 It was all arranged by some witch if memory serves.

 I have heard nothing of him since, so I presume he is
 now dead.  He always was a bumbling fool."

 The King sends men on occasion to assail the dragon,
 though I can hardly see why.  It lives upon an island
 and rarely bothers us.

 My belief is that the King sends men who have displeased
 him, so that it will kill them."

 sure knowledge of my conquest.  Yet he is not idle, for
 he has already sent men to poison me.

 Indeed, my Lady and manservant live only for she has a
 ring bejewelled with todestone, that glows in presence
 of poisons.  Thus were they warned.

 Of course, the poison cannot harm ME."

"When this treachery failed, the King's attempts did
 become more direct.

 Why barely a moon ago, five men with swords burst into
 the house and clove my skull.
 Fortunately the wound healed as the blade passed
 through, yet it were days afore I could remember my
 Lady's name.

 I know not what happened to these men, but my Lady tells
 that they were smitten by lightning, inside the house!"
