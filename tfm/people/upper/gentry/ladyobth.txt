 Less it is that you are lost, I would imagine you came

 you myself, if I can."

"When I came of age, I visited a seer who foretold that I
 should marry with a man of great quality and power.

 When, later that year, I was wed to a handsome general
 who was in line to the throne, I believed that the
 prophecy was fulfilled.  But now that I know the whole
 truth of the matter, it fills me with dread!"

"Yea, but I fear he is too full o' the milk of human
 badness to catch the gentle path to the throne.

 I can see that his accession, if it takes place as is
 foretold, shall be a bloody one indeed.

 His sinistrous plotting will bring doom upon us all!"

"My husband, Thane-Lord O'Beth, is the centre of a grim
 prophecy that he shall be immortal and usurp the throne
 of Scotia after an act of most foul treason, likely the
 murder of King Duncan the Foolish.

 There are other parts of the prophecy, but they are
 of little consequence.  If it interests you deeply, you
 may find the prophecies in the study.

 My husband applies himself to fulfilling the prophecy
 with great vigour, and is constantly devising foul
 schemes to storm the castle."

"Mad?  If only that were so.  Most of the Prophecies are
 fulfilled, and no mortal can harm him.

 To kill a king and seize his throne is a dreadful deed.
 But he means to do it, and nothing can stop him!"
