"Justice is the wages of sin.

 For some it is mere jail..  Others must pay for their
 deeds in blood!

 The Church has lent us a fully-equipped torturer for
 dealing with heretics and witches."

"In times of poverty there is much theft.
 If the item be small, jail is the answer.

 For the theft of a horse or something of equal value,
 the necessary justice shall be the gallows-tree!

 As the tithes of the Church increase we see more and
 more false dealings.
 The justice for this crime is imprisonment."
