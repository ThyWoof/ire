"I am the King's military planner.
 It is fortunate that we have peace with most other kings
 in the land these days, for the LORD runs a tight ship
 and earthly quarrels displease Him.

 But there are other concerns, for the beasts and the
 devils of the forest become ever bolder.  Much of my
 time is spent planning defences for our town to keep the
 beasts at bay.

 I fear also that another assault may be needed against
 the evil things in the east."

"There are fell creatures in the woods.  Where there is
 water you may be prey to fell todes that spit poison
 and fire at the unwary.

 It is worst at night, for that is when the imps come..
 during the day we have much less to fear.

 To the south is a place where Demons live.  It is not
 a good place and you should avoid it.  My grandfather
 led a crushing victory against them and they have been
 quiet for a long time since."

"As you head eastwards, the forces of the Enemy grow more
 numerous. There are devils that take the form of woolves
 but are clever as a man and can work metal.

 Some years ago the LORD led us to war against them and
 a good victory was won for the Trinity.

 We would have slain any other foe completely but these
 creatures are hardy and most difficult to kill.
 The LORD told us not to bother."
