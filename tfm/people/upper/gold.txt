> Where does gold come from?


"Many believe it is mined from the earth by dog-sized
 ants.  Others claim it is mined by ant-sized dogs.

 But I know that most of it is mined by the Dark Waargs
 of the east.  They are woolves that have embraced the
 left-handed path of The Adversary.

 It is funny, is it not, that the coins of the realm come
 from the servants of darkness?  The priests do sometimes
 say that money is the root of evil.

 That is where most of the gold comes from.  The rest is
 given directly to the Church by the LORD Himself.  It is
 said that He makes it from the sea, but I know not if
 this be true."
