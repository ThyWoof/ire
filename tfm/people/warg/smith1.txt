"Metalworking is not an easy thing.  It requires you to
 know some spells.  Mostly they are protective spells,
 to shield you from the heat of the forge, or to carry
 a white-hot ingot in your mouth.

 It also requires much strength in the forepaws to
 lift the hammer-glove and bring it down on the hot
 iron."

"Well, unless you have a Waarg companion who needs
 arms or armour, I doubt I have much in the way of goods
 to offer you.

 I will however melt down gold into ingots if that would
 be useful to you.  In exchange, I will keep the surplus."

[colour="#808080"]
The blacksmith and his assistant quickly melt down the
gold, and pour it into a mould.  As the gold begins to
cool, they smooth off the top of the ingot, taking the
swarf as payment.

The blacksmith places the fresh gold bar at your feet.
