"I am KindTongue.  It is a traditional name for one who
 shows aptitude for healing at an early age.

 Traditionally we licked our wounds and waited for them
 to heal, but The Betrayer taught us of hearbs and
 potions that cause our wounds to heal more swiftly, and
 cure poisons that we could not heal otherwise. 

 He also taught us spells that are even more effective."

"I have an ensorcelled potion that heals most injuries,
 or I can cure poisons as well.

 But if you have the need, when the night is at its
 darkest, and with the aid of skilled mages, I can 
 sometimes raise the dead."

 humans..  The ointments and potions I use upon my own
 kind may not work well on men.
 
 In fact, they might worsen your wounds, not cure them.

 If you truly require this service, place the body of

 when you are ready for the service to be carried out.

 If you require any other healing in the mean-time,
 just ask me."
