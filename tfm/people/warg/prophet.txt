He closes his eyes and cowers before you.

"I am called ????.  Once I was a member of the
 weaver's guild, but for many years I have also been a
 seer.

 A few short years ago I gave a prophecy which upset the
 King.  He ordered my banishment, and I now live my life
 as a hermit.

 That prophecy concerns you."

"It was a good living.  Turning thread into cloth was a
 satisfying job.  I also built looms and made countless
 improvements to our basic design.  For this I was on
 good terms with the guild.

 While the glory days of the weavers are now past, I know
 that all the looms in use today are of my design."

"The weavers' guild became too powerful, and the King saw
 it as a threat to his authority.

 The guild was accused of siding with The Betrayer.
 Nonsense of course, but it made a convenient excuse for
 him to abolish the guild, imprison its members and seize
 all their land and assets.  The only weavers today are
 freelancers.

 I was imprisoned for five years.  Many others are still
 serving their sentences, or fled to seek sanctuary in 
 other towns.

 It was during my years in jail that I discovered my
 mystical talents."

"The gift of Seeing depends upon the of the full moon.
 While the moon waxes, and afterwards as it
 wanes, the visions become faint and lose their substance
 rapidly.  Most of the visions are but pale shadows.

 But the moon does not only affect when I can See, it
 also affects WHAT I can See.  We who have the gift can
 only See things which are lit by the full moon.
 As the moon fades in the daylight hours the visions
 again lose clarity.

 The gift is limited, but it can on occasion be of
 great use.  In days past there would be great Seeings
 where prophets from all around would converge on the
 night of the full moon, and enter the trance together."

"Alas, the new King disapproves of our gift, and he has
 declared that such gatherings be outlawed, saying that
 they are a work of the Betrayer.

 You see, it was at one of these Seeings that I received
 a vision of King Redtooth's dethronement, and when the
 King learned of this he flew into a great rage.

 So angered was he that I was lucky to escape with my
 life, but his councillors prevailed upon him.
 Under torture I was forced to recant what I had Seen,
 and I think that it was my vision which has moved the
 King to outlaw the Seeings.

 Since then I have been in constant ridicule, so I now
 live alone."

"The Betrayer was our God, and we worshipped Him until
 the humans came along, and He lost interest in us.

 Then He told us that He would have his humans kill us
 all, and there was a great war against them.
 When the old King was slain in battle, the attacks
 ended, but we still revile the God for His evil deeds.

 Sadly, the Betrayal and the beginning of the war took
 place upon days of the new moon and could not be
 foreseen.. as was the murder of our King."

"There were twenty of us in the Seeing, as is usually the
 case.  For time is strange, and not everything that is
 Seen will happen.  Different prophets will See different
 things, but by counting up those who agree on an event
 we can determine how likely that event is.

 In the Seeing, I Saw many things.  I Saw you, with a
 number of companions.  Many others saw this too, but
 no others saw you with a Waarg companion.

 I alone saw was that one of your companions was no less
 than our own King Grey, returned from the dead to fight
 against Aa'Ruuff the Betrayer Himself, and to dethrone
 King Redtooth the Usurper.

 That is what I Saw."
