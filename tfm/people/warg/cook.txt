"The evil god Aa'Ruuf the Betrayer taught our people
 how to preserve food by heating it until it browns
 or infusing it with smoke from a wood fire.
 
 This is my job.. preserving food, and then
 preparing it for my liege to eat."

"We have long known that meat and hearbs together are
 more pleasant to eat than the meat or hearbs alone.

 The Betrayer showed us many hearbs that were good to
 eat, and taught us that the milk of sheep and cows
 could be turned into a delicious substance that He
 called 'cream', or a hard, tasty stuff called 'cheese'
 that does not become sour.

 Our people mostly eat cooked or prepared food now.
 Although in the past we ate fresh meat daily, it is
 now considered a delicacy for it does not keep long."

"Ah.  It is not an easy matter and takes skill to be done
 properly.  The Betrayer considered it a sin for food to
 have been touched by another's mouth before it is eaten.

 Although we no longer do the Betrayer worship, this
 matter has become a social custom.

 I have many tools that allow food to be prepared using
 only paws, or mouth-gloves.  I also know some spells to
 aid with the process of cooking.

 But I can tell you little else, for most of our
 techniques are secrets of the guild."

"King Redtooth is my liege.  I serve him as best I am
 able.  Others have said that his rule may be less fair
 than rulers past, but it is not my place to judge him.

 This I will say.. our new king has a hearty appetite,
 much more so than his predecessor, Grey.

 Grey preferred fresh meat which he caught with his own
 mouth, so I did not often prepare meals for him
 personally.  He did enjoy my sweetmeats, though.

 Of course, it was Grey's love for hunting which brought
 about his downfall."

"Of course, you might not know of that.  Every Waarg
 knows the tragedy of King Grey.

 It came the year that our God, Aa'Ruuff turned against
 us.  He sent creatures like yourself to assail our land
 and attack our people.  King Grey organised our defence,
 for he was a master strategist as well as a wise and
 fair ruler.

 But Aa'Ruuff The Betrayer sent assassins into the wild
 woods where Grey loved to hunt.  They hid until he came
 and then they attacked before his guards could respond."
