You see a wolf-like creature in armour with some kind of
crossbow attached to a harness around his back.  He
speaks in a strange, snarling voice.

 of the Waarg?

 Who are you, and what do you want?"

"You stand at the gates of the city-state of Yapp,
 principal city of the Waarg, and slowly being rebuilt
 after the unjust war waged upon us by your God.

 Our leader is good King Redtooth, and he has decreed
 that humans are not welcome unless it can be proved that
 you bear no ill-will."

The creature steps backwards in surprise.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"What?  Do you not worship the Betrayer?

 Aa'Ruuff taught us to build and keep livestock.
 We worshipped Him for centuries, but He turned against
 us and sent His human servants to kill us!"

The creature sniffs.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"What does it look like?  I'm guarding the city entrance
 against humans!  Humans worship the evil God Aa'Ruuff
 who tried to annihilate his own faithful worshippers!

 Humans are not welcome here after the war brought about
 by His evil, and YOUR complicity!"

The creature relaxes.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"If you are not in league with Him, then I see little
 reason why you should not enter our city.
 
 But the memories of the carnage wrought by your people
 are still fresh, so you must wear a Favour about your
 neck.  It shall be a sign that you mean our people no
 harm.
 
 And any mischief you cause shall be dealt with severely!
 
 Are these conditions acceptable to you?"

"Then know that your kind is not welcome in these parts,
 for you stole the liking of our God Aa'Ruuff, resulting
 in war and terrible carnage.
 
 However.  If you are merely exploring the land, you may
 enter the city.  But you must wear a Favour about your
 neck, as a token of peaceful intent.
 
 And I must warn you that if you DO commit any violence,
 it shall be dealt with most harshly!

The creature snarls angrily and snaps at the air.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"The Trinity does not exist!  It is a fabrication of
 Aa'Ruuff that He uses to obtain your worship.

 You still worship Aa'Ruuff, whatever name He chooses to
 go by!  If you are devotees of the Betrayer, leave now!"

The guards deliberate for a while.  A messenger goes to
their leader, and soon his decision comes back.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Very well, you may enter the city, but there are two
 conditions.

 Firstly, you must wear a Favour about your neck, this
 shall be a sign that you come in peace.
 
 And secondly, any violence you commit will be taken as
 a betrayal of our trust, and punished harshly.
 
 Do you still wish to enter the city?"
