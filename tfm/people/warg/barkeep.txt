"I have few human customers of late, so what I sell is
 intended for Waarg consumption, but you should find it
 edible.

 I have a meat broth or salted meat for 3 gold, or a
 fruit for a single gold coin.
 To drink we have water, milk and of course, beer.
 Water and milk are 1 gold coin, beer is 2 gold coins.

 I can't find any cups, so you will have to take your
 beverages in a bowl, I'm afraid."

"Well, the humans show no signs of attacking, and the
 price of beer is steady.

 The Betrayer has been quiet too, except some nights ago,
 when the sky turned pale and letters were seen moving
 through the air.  It said 'magicserver abended, please
 restart', and the message was repeated five times, but
 no-one knows what that means."
