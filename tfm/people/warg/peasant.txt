"I am Snow-paw, the threadmaster.  I provide thread to
 the weavers.

 My family has been in this trade for many generations
 and we have refined the techniques of threadmaking over
 this time.

 We can supply anything from the thinnest fibre, to the
 strongest ropes for boats and building."

"Our thread is made from the bark of the Yrmwat bush,
 the plants that grow on my farmland.
 
 When they are ripe, we gather the harvest, and strip
 the bark off so it can be spun into thread."
