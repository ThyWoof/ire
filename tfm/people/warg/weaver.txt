 was assassinated!

============ POLITICS ===================

[page="kings"]

 beloved King Grey?"

[page="redtooth"]
[image="weaver.png"]
"He is our current King. It is not proper to speak ill of
 him, yet there are those who feel that his reign
 is less ..just.. than that of our old King.
 
 I was only ten when the war ended, and I can tell
 you little of the old times of King Grey.  But
 others say that he paid much more attention to the
 welfare of his subjects than our present King does."
 
 To be sure, our Royal Majesty has rebuilt the
 Castle with great speed.  But most everyone else
 still lives in these crude huts of wood and thatch
 that were built as temporary shelter after the
 war.."

SureTooth lowers his voice to a curious, doggy
whispering.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"At Grey's death, his younger brother, SwiftRunner,
 took the crown.  His rule was fair and good, but
 he was inexperienced, and General RedTooth, as he
 was then known, usurped the throne in a coup.

 I cannot say much more about His Majesty, but I
 urge you to take care if you would speak to others
 on this matter.  It is not wise to question the
 King's rule openly, for walls may have ears, and
 our King is far less tolerant of criticism than his
 predecessor.  His ire can be terrible."

 he was ever in the shadow of his elder brother's
 greatness.

 He was dethroned and exiled by an ambitious general, who
 was then crowned King Redtooth.  He is now our King."

"Grey was a noble ruler, and well-loved by his
 subjects.  He had a silver-grey coat, which is
 quite unusual among our race.
 
 He was picked as successor by the previous king,
 who abdicated when he felt he was too old to rule.
 
 Grey was close to Aa'Ruuff, and even had audiences
 with Him.  Yet he was no puppet.  At the Betrayal,
 Grey swore vengance against Aa'Ruuff and put his
 mind to defending our realm, with great success.
 
 If you have seen the Field of Bones, you will note
 that most of the dead are not Waarg."

[page="grey2"]
[image="weaver.png"]
"Grey's downfall was brought about by Aa'Ruuff.
 Not only King, but our main strategist, he was a
 prime target for assassination.
 
 Part of Grey's secret to success, it is said, was
 that he always hunted his own food.  Other kings
 were waited on by their servants, but Grey wanted
 to be as much like his subjects as possible.

 Aa'Ruuff sent a human, armed with a weapon that
 shot metal, and so Grey was slain while hunting."

 do know that it was started by Aa'Ruuff, and it was this
 act of violence against His own Faithful, that lead to
 our rejection of Him as our God.

 If you would know more, I suggest you find an elder
 waarg to ask, for I was but young when the war was
 ended."
