You see a large Waarg in peak condition and a red
pentagram dyed into the fur of his back.

"The pentagram is a symbol of magical power.  Wherever
 the symbol is painted, strong magical force will be
 concentrated.  Having the pentagram upon my back gives
 me a constant source of power for binding and
 maintaining spells.
 
 It also makes my youth spell more practical.

 Others prefer a special place where spells can
 be bound.  The pentagram is usually on the floor.
 I also have one in my study.. having two is useful
 for the binding of very powerful spells."

"Certainly not!

 You are an enemy of our race.  As long as you wear the
 Favour, your presence here will be tolerated.
 
 But I shall not endanger all our lives by giving you the
 power to destroy us!"

"I fear my answer is still 'no'.

 Even if you do not wish to destroy us, there is a risk
 that you would pass the knowledge on to those who do!
 
 It would be safer for us all if I do not teach you."

"Then I shall not help you further it; even good spells
 can be misused for evil intent.

 If as you claim, you wish our people no harm, I beg that
 you tell no-one what you have learned until such time as
 the war between our races is over."

"Many years ago, the God - Aa'Ruuff - whom we worshipped
 turned against his faithful, and sent an army of men to
 invade our villages.

 Many fierce battles were fought, and the last such was
 but ten years ago.  Your people slew our beloved King
 Grey and his younger brother claimed the crown.  His
 weak and ineffectual reign was ended by the courage of
 our present King RedTooth, who took the throne by force.

 So you see, a mere decade ago, you men slew our King in
 an unprovoked attack against our people.  Time is a
 great healer, but we will not quickly forgive all your
 race has done."

 Regrettably, I must remain here and serve my King."
