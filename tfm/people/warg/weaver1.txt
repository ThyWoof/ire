"I am SureTooth the weaver.  Good mouth coordination is necessary for this
 and many other professions.  My parents noticed I had the gift early on,
 and so they named me "SureTooth".
 
 What is it that you want?"

[page="job2"]

"What?  Er, it was the looms.  I used to watch the other weavers as a cub,
 I was always fascinated by the way they worked.  So I became an apprentice.
 
 But then the war against the humans broke out.  Many died, and after the war,
 King Grey was assassinated.  When Lord Redtooth took the throne, the guild of
 the Royal Weavers fell out of favour and was disbanded.  All the guild members
 were imprisoned or banished.  Now, only a handful of independent weavers
 remain.
 
 Tell me, why have you come here?"

"I am a Waarg.  We are the inhabitants of this land.  We were raised from
 from dumb beasts by our God, Aa'Ruuff, now called "Aa'Ruuff The Betrayer".

 We don't worship Him now, not after the Great Battle against Men..."

occurs to him.
