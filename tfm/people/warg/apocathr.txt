[page="potions"]

"I stock several kinds of magical brew.  We dye them so
 that they are easy to tell apart.

 The green potions are poisonous and should not be drunk,
 but they are useful for killing rats and removing fleas.

 Red potions are a fast-acting antidote to most toxins,
 including snake venom and the rat poison.

 Yellow potions are restorative and allow wounds to heal
 very rapidly.  Blue potions induce a refreshing sleep.

 White potions are made from a particular kind of magical
 mushroom, and allow the drinker to see things normally
 hidden.  Drinking too much can be dangerous."
