"I am KindTongue.  It is a traditional name for one who
 shows aptitude for healing at an early age.

 Traditionally we licked our wounds and waited for them
 to heal, but The Betrayer taught us of hearbs and
 potions that cause our wounds to heal more swiftly, and
 cure poisons that we could not heal otherwise. 

 He also taught us spells that are even more effective."

"I have an ensorcelled potion that heals most injuries,
 or I can cure poisons as well.

 But if you have the need, when the night is at its
 darkest, and with the aid of skilled mages, I can 
 sometimes raise the dead.."

The creature looks at you thoughtfully.

"I was afraid of that.  I do not have many dealings with
 humans..  The ointments and potions I use upon my own
 kind may not work well on men.
 
 In fact, they might worsen your wounds, not cure them.
 
 My cost will be 10 gold monies, and as this is to pay
 for the potions, I fear I cannot refund you if the
 healing is not successful.

 Do you still wish me to try and heal you?"
