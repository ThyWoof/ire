"Oh, that's part of our little working song.  We always
 sing 'After The Flesh' by the Thrill-Kill Cult.

 I sing the guitar parts.  Ugly sings the lead, Fatso does
 the bassline, Girly and Sleazy chant the samples and
 Surly sings the drums.  Stupid sings like a pig, so we
 make sure he stays quiet most of the time."

"Oh, she's just a sweet little girl who came here one
 day.  She washed our clothes and cooked our food for us,
 until one fateful day, when a wicked witch slew her
 with a poisoned mango yoghurt.  I think..

 It is said that she is not dead, but sleeping, and the
 kiss of a handsome traveller will break the spell."
