[page="start"]

[colour="#808080"]
You see very effeminate-looking dwarf, with long hair, a
high-pitched voice, and a beard.

He is chanting something in a nearly incoherent voice.

"'YadaYadaYadaYadaYadaDontWannaDie!!'

 Hey!  You're interrupting the song!"

[colour="#808080"]
You see Girly, one of the Seven Dwarves.  The others
quieten down as he says his piece.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"'There's a lot of innocent people.. being crucified.'"

[colour="#808080"]
Then the other dwarves all go into a frenzy.

"Take over, please, Sleazy.

 You're interrupting the song!"

He coughs.

 We're not really miners, we're gardeners."

"It's part of 'After The Flesh' by the Thrill-Kill Cult.
 It's a happy little song we sing while we're working.

 Ugly sings the vocals, and Dopey sings the guitar parts.
 Fatso does the bassline, Sleazy and I chant the samples
 and Surly sings the drums.  Stupid can't sing."

"Oh no.  If we spent all our time playing instruments
 we'd never get any work done.

 We used to have a boom-box, but the LORD confiscated it.
 HE said it was 'an unlawful technological artifact'."

"Oh, she was a cute little thing who came here seeking
 refuge from someone who had it in for her.

 Anyway, we let her stay, and in exchange she helped us
 by washing our clothes and cooking our food.
 She did my hair as well.

 But all good things come to an end, and this evil witch
 came along and slew her with a poisoned pear.

 But some say that she is not dead, only sleeping, and
 the kiss of a handsome traveller will break the spell."
