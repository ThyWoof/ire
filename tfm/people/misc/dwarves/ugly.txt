The other dwarves all go into a frenzy.  The druggy one
does some kind of frantic guitar solo.

"'After The Flesh' by My Life With The Thrill-Kill Cult.
  We always sing it while we're working.

 I do the vocals.  Dopey sings the guitar parts, Fatso
 does the bassline, Girly and Sleazy chant the samples
 and Surly sings the drums.  We don't let Stupid sing."

"Snow white was a pretty little girl who came here one
 day.  I think she was on the run from her parents or
 something.

 Anyway, she came here and we put her up.  In exchange,
 she earned her keep by washing our clothes and cooking
 our food.

 Then one fateful day, a wicked witch slew her with a
 poisoned apple.

 But they do say that she is not dead, only sleeping, and
 the kiss of a handsome traveller will break the spell."
