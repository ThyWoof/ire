"Hail, friend!

 I am the Prince of the lost realm of Agnar, sent into
 exile by the treacherous cur who slew my father and
 usurped his throne!

 I seek a bold warrior to help me in my quest to avenge
 my father's murder and regain the kingdom!

 Will you aid me in this quest?"

[link="Yes, gladly."]

[link="No, not today."]

"If you would seek to aid my quest, meet up with me in
 the mountains to the East of this land.
 There is a cave leading through to my realm.

 I shall march on the usurper alone if need be, but any
 who help me regain the throne shall be richly rewarded."

 Meet up with me in the mountains to the East.
 There is a cave leading through to my realm.. together
 we shall march on the usurper.

 If I regain the throne you shall be richly rewarded."

"Then I shall seek help elsewhere.

 Nevertheless, if you should change your mind, meet up
 with me in the mountains to the East.
 There is a cave leading through to my realm.

 I shall march on the usurper alone if need be, but any
 who help me regain the throne shall be richly rewarded."
