You see some kind of robot panther.  The creature's eyes
contract to points.

"I was on a mission in the deadlands power plant.
 We sent a number of humans to try and fix the
 problems with the generators.

 None of the humans returned and I was sent
 to investigate.

 I found several bodies, but before I could
 identify the remains, a ball of plasma
 appeared in the centre of the room.

 It... it SPOKE to me!  It demanded I leave, but
 before I could, it killed me!"
