"Hail, warrior.

 I am the lost Prince of the realm of Agnar.

 I was to rule the land when my father died, but the
 throne was usurped by a treacherous cur and I was sent
 into exile.

 I seek a bold warrior to help avenge my father and
 regain my kingdom.

 Would you aid this quest?"

"If you would truly aid my quest, meet up with me among
 the mountains in the East of this land.  There is a cave
 amongst the mountains that leads through to my homeland.

 If need be, I shall assail the King alone.  But any who
 aid me in my quest to slay the traitor will be rewarded
 most generously."

"Meet up with me among the mountains in the East of this
 land.  There is a cave amongst the mountains that leads
 through to my homeland.

 Together, we shall assail the traitor, and I shall sit
 upon the throne which is rightfully mine!
 Any who aid me in this will be rewarded most generously."

"Very well.  If need be, I shall assail the traitor alone.

 But if you do change your mind, meet up with me among
 the mountains in the East of this land.  There is a cave
 amongst the mountains that leads through to my homeland.

 Remember, any who aid me in recovering my throne will be
 rewarded most generously."
