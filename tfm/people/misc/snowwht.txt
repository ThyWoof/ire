 I'm not quite sure why, actually.  She had some kind of
 problem with me.

 If you do run into her, could you possibly find out why
 she cursed me?  I'm sure we can sort this out like
 adults."

 southeast of here, bordering the eastern desert.  You
 might be able to visit it, you might not.  Depends
 what the king's policies are these days.

 The new king doesn't like humans much, but we have
 traded with members of your species ever since they came
 to our world and there are lots of things we cannot
 easily make ourselves.  Without human traders, the
 kingdom would collapse into another civil war."
