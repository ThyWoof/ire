You see seven dwarves, singing 'After The Flesh' by the
industrial band 'My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult'. 

One dwarf sings the vocals, another sings the drum parts.
Two more dwarves sing bass and guitar parts respectively,
and the rest chant samples and sound-bites from the song.

As they notice you, the music dies away and fourteen
eyes are focussed squarely upon you.
