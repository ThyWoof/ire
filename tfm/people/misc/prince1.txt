"Hail, fellow wanderer.

 I am the lost Prince of the realm of Agnar.

 I was to rule the land when my father died, but the
 throne was usurped by a treacherous cur and I was sent
 into exile.

 I seek a bold warrior to help avenge my father and
 regain my kingdom.  Will you aid me?"

"If you wish to aid my quest, meet up with me by the
 mountains to the East.
 There you should find a cave that leads through to my
 realm.

 I shall march on the usurper alone if need be, but any
 who help me regain the throne shall be richly rewarded."

"How I thank you!

 Meet up with me by the mountains to the East.
 There you should find a cave that leads through to my
 realm.  Together we shall march on the usurper.

 If I regain the throne you shall be richly rewarded."

"Hmm.  That is ill news.

 Nevertheless, if you should change your mind, meet up
 with me by the mountains to the East.
 There you should find a cave that leads through to my
 realm.

 I shall march on the usurper alone if need be, but any
 who help me regain the throne shall be richly rewarded."

 vile impostor.

 I alone am the true Prince.

 Anyway, will you aid my quest?"
