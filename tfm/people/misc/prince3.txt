"Hold, warrior!

 I am the exiled Prince of the realm of Agnar.

 I was to rule the land of my father when he died, but
 instead his throne was usurped by a foul traitor!

 My father was slain and I was sent into exile by the
 new King.

 I seek a bold warrior to aid me in my quest.
 The cur must be put to justice so I can reclaim the
 throne and restore harmony to the kingdom of my father.

 Would you aid me in my quest?"

[link="Yes, gladly."]

"If you would aid my quest, meet up with me at the
 mountain pass in the East.   There is a cave leading
 through to the sacred realm of Agnar.

 If need be, I shall go alone.  But any who aid me in
 reclaiming the throne shall be richly rewarded."

"You have my deepest gratitude!

 Meet up with me at the mountain pass in the East.
 There is a cave leading through to the realm of Agnar.

 Together, we shall march on the usurper and reclaim
 the stolen throne!

 If we succeed, you shall be richly rewarded."

"A curse upon the usurper!  Who will aid me?

 If you do change your mind, meet up with me at the
 mountain pass in the East.  There is a cave leading
 through to the realm of Agnar.

 If need be, I shall go alone.  But any who aid me in
 reclaiming the throne shall be richly rewarded."
