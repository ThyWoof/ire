"I'm an Engineer.. I can only really tell you about the
 hardware.  If you want to know more about the system
 software, I suggest you ask Librarian Rulyz or
 High-Programmer Saaxiis.

 Xy'lan lives inside the ship's mainframe, which is a
 massively parallel computing engine.  It uses many small
 computing nodes on a SYZURG quantum interconnect bus."

"We didn't build it, we prayed for it, and it appeared.

 We had to pray with an alpha-3 override to ensure the
 job went through properly.  Xy'lan jammed that channel
 immediately afterwards, of course.

 It's a standard NRC-6 survival shelter, built into a
 mountain by the sea.  The pumping station extracts rare
 earth elements from the ocean, allowing us to build
 semiconductors or any other parts for our starship."

 system.  Such things have to be specified with utmost
 precision, so it's easier to program the magicserver
 directly.

 We prayed for the furniture though."

"The Maxima is a fairly standard Drakaan exploratory
 ship.  It has twin redundant power systems, crew
 quarters, hydroponics and a large cargo area.
 The bridge is located at the front of the craft.

 There are two warp drives, components of which run the
 length of the vessel.  The bridge contains most of our
 computing resources, including the magicserver, and of
 course, Xy'lan's mainframe."

 small computing nodes housed inside a single cabinet.
 These nodes use a mixture of several technologies, but
 they all have a very high component density."

"Xy'lan has projected a number of barriers in the sky to
 prevent air-traffic between the military bases.
 A similar effect is used to jam communications.

 Removing these barriers will be hard.. I suspect that
 Xy'lan has loaded the program directly into the
 magicserver.  We would need physical access to the
 machinery aboard the Maxima in order to do this.

 If you think that you could make your way to the ship,
 we can probably sort something out.  But it would be
 very dangerous."

"Solving, or at least working around the communications
 problem is much easier.  I have designed and prayed for
 a number of communicators, one for each base and a spare
 just in case.

 These devices are based on our own technology, as
 opposed to the RF which your culture favours.  The
 barrier will be ineffective against them.

 If you can visit all three of the air bases and give each
 one a communicator, we will at last be able to talk to
 the air craft, and they will also be able to talk amongst
 themselves without interference from Xy'lan."

"Xy'lan has set up a number of barriers in the sky to
 prevent air-traffic between the military bases and he
 has also jammed communications between them.

 We cannot take down the barriers without boarding the
 Maxima and it is too early to consider such a thing.
 However, the communications devices I have given you
 should allow us to bypass the signal jamming.

 If you can deliver one to each of the three bases,
 we should be able to make some headway against the
 barriers."
