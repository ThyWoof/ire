"Our mission was to study, and potentially terraform
 worlds in a sector of the galaxy previously impractical
 for us to visit easily.

 My role was to study and document any indigenous life
 on the world.  Now that your race has begun colonising
 the world it makes that job harder, and in some ways
 less important.

 That said, I may be able to share some useful data
 with you.  The birds you call 'ospreys' are especially
 interesting."

"So far as we can tell, this world had no intelligent
 life of its own prior to our arrival.

 The most advanced lifeform was a small furry carnivore
 resembling the wolves of your world due to convergent
 evolution.

 Seeking worshippers, Xy'Lan began to mutate them,
 using his magic and advanced nanotechnology to 
 increase their intelligence to something like that of
 your own.  They call themselves the Waarg and are
 capable of speech."

"However, when you humans arrived, Xy'Lan dropped that
 project of uplifting the Waarg-creatures to a state
 where they were useful worshippers.

 He instead concentrated on enslaving your kind, since
 you have hands, but the Waarg-creatures require magic
 to manipulate and move objects.

 Thus, the Waarg-creatures fell out with Xy'Lan whom
 they now call 'The Betrayer'.

 If you have not already established contact with them,
 they may provide useful allies to our cause."

"The ospreys are not native to this world, but seeded
 from stock brought here by you humans.

 However, they have recently been building nesting
 platforms and other structures of their own, a feat
 far beyond their native intelligence and physical
 capability.  Image enhancement shows that they are
 able to project laser beams psychically which they
 use to fell trees, or destroy enemies."

"These capabilities are not natural and are assuredly
 the work of Xy'Lan.  It is certain to me that he has
 been modifying them with nano-devices to increase their
 intelligence.

 We do not know why, since he has a clear preference for
 humans as worshippers, but there is obviously some
 reason for his continued interest.

 The other thing we do not know is whether they are
 grateful to Xy'Lan for increasing their intellect or
 are opposed to his goals."

"Toads are primitive amphibian life, an invasive species
 brought by you humans in your colonisation project.

 Rulyz tells me that that they have developed limited
 speech and spellcasting abilities under Xy'Lan's sway,
 using a psionic amplifier crystal embedded in the
 creature's brain.

 We think that Xy'Lan uses them as semi-autonomous
 drones to spy on people."
