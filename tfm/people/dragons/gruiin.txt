"I am the Spellmaster.  It is my duty to learn and study
 the various magics which we are likely to need in our
 mission.

 With the right computing equipment, I can also custom
 design new spells, or modify existing ones to better
 suit our requirements.

 Have you ever wondered why you wake up after you have
 died?  That was my doing.. we loaded the resurrection
 spell into the magicserver.
 I had expected Xy'lan to interfere, though.  Evidently
 He wants to keep you alive as well."

"I have two ring six spells that I can teach you.

 First, the Peer spell, which connects data from your
 satellites into your brain, allowing you to see the
 area around you from above.

 I can also give you the All-Seeing-Eye spell, which
 is similar but more chaotic.  It shows you flashes
 of the land.  Not very stable.  I'll fix it someday."

 The Ring 7 'Light Heal' spell is just a demo.

 poison."

"Again, I have two ring four spells I can share with you.

 First, the Mark spell, which you cast upon a glass orb.
 You give an identifying number as a parameter.  Then,
 if you cast Recall later on, you will be brought back to
 wherever the orb was.

 This spell hasn't been very well tested before it was
 released and it has a few problems.  It doesn't work
 over very large distances, and it has few safeguards.
 If you put the orb inside a container and teleport to
 it, you will not have a fun time.

 And whatever you do, NEVER teleport to an orb you are
 carrying in your pocket!"

 I can give you a utility that we use for diagnosing our
 artificial intelligences.  We call it 'Hear Truth'.
 It is only intended to work on our AIs, and I'm not sure
 what it will do if you use it on ones from your planet.

 However, you may find a use for it, perhaps on one of
 Xy'lan's servants."

 The first is Posess, which allows you to control the
 mind of another.
 I can also teach you a similar spell, which causes
 people to forget what they were doing and follow you
 around.  In your tongue, it would be called the
 'Pied Piper' spell.  We have a similar legend of our
 own."

"Ring zero?  Are you sure that you are ready for this
 kind of power?

 Very well, but use it wisely.  These spells can be VERY
 dangerous.  At the moment I have two to offer you.

 First, I have the resurrection spell, which can revive
 fallen comrades.  I also have a hacked version of the
 Peer spell, that can see inside buildings.  It has a few
 problems."

As Gruiin explains the spell's mechanics in great
detail, you write notes and incantations inside your
