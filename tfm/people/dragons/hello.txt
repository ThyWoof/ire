"Yes, last time we visited, many thousands of years ago.
 Bit of a mess that was.  We announced ourselves openly to
 the people; it always worked before.
 
 But this time it messed up.  Started many myths in China,
 not too bad.  But we came into conflict with the
 followers of Ahura-Mazda.  That got real messy, we had
 to abort our mission.
 
 Never should have tried to contact so young a race."
