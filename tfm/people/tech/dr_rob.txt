Dr. Robertson interrupts with an awkward gesture,
taking the sight of the alien commander in his stride.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Commander, I'm just a doctor of xenobiology.  I am the
 most senior surviving member of this base, but I...

"...I'm just not cut out to lead.  Not to burden you with
 my troubles, I mean... I just don't want you to get your
 hopes up."

"Ah, you have my sympathies, Doctor.  These are trying
 times for all of us.

 Fortunately, we may be able to help you.  I have sent
 you this communications device of our own design, which
 will not be affected by Xy'lan's jamming signals.

 Once these devices have been given to all three of your
 bases, you will again be able to talk to your comrades
 who may be able to assist you in the running of your
 base.
 And, once all are in contact, we can then discuss my
 proposals for dealing with Xy'lan in more detail."

[colour="#808080"]
Dr. Robertson looks noticably happier at the prospect
of assistance.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Commander, that would be most helpful.  The other units
 will have to be hand-delivered, though.  We cannot
 breach the sky-barriers."

[nextpage="comms_unit6"]

"Sadly, yes.  They will have to be delivered by our
 friend here.  I do not ask for your aid in delivering
 them, Doctor - but if you can offer any help to $him
 that would be most useful.

 Oh, and if you can have someone watching the
 communicator at all times, that would help too.

 In the meantime, I can send you biological data
 regarding the Drakaan race, if it will not distract
 you too much.  I believe your computers will be able
 to interpret it.

 For now, farewell."

[colour="#808080"]
Dr. Robertson looks at you as the comms device shuts off.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Well, well.  I think is our first contact with another
 star-going race!  So much to learn...

 Meanwhile, I guess you'd better deliver the other
 communicators.  Commander Ransome's base is at New
 Fairford to the south, and Commander Argus runs the
 Panavius intelligence facility in the southeast.

 If there's anything here in the base that can help you
 on this mission, feel free."

"Greetings, Doctor.

 I am Commander Gurd of the Drakaan research team, and I
 wish to propose an alliance against Xy'lan, whom the
 humans worship as a god.

 As a token of our good faith, I have sent you this
 communications device of our own design, which will not
 be affected by Xy'lan's jamming signals.

 Now that these devices have been given to all three of
 your bases, you will again be able to talk to your
 comrades.

 Now that everyone is in contact, we can then discuss my

[colour="#808080"]
As all the comms units are linked together, there is a
tremendous babel of voices as the three base commanders
attempt to catch up on decades worth of news.

Eventually, Gurd butts in and calls the meeting to order.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Gentlemen, gentlemen.. Xy'lan waits for no-one.
 We must first discuss the plan, then you may talk as
 you will.

 As I suppose you are aware, it was our race that created
 the mad god, so it is therefore our responsibility to
 un-create Him.  But we lack the resources to manage this
 on our own.

 I have therefore decided to place our knowledge and
 skill at your disposal, that we may be able do together
 what cannot be done alone."
