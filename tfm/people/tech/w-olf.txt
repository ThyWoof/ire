 For that I am eternally grateful."

"I am an anthrocyberwolf.  We are experimental androids
 designed as stealth operatives, and fitted with
 invisibility field generators.

 However, since the Church has massacred the ground crew
 in this base, we have been reassigned, and now perform
 maintainance on the the aircraft and panthers here.

 I was sent to spy on the Church, but as you know, that
 did not go to plan."

 and am capable of performing delicate adjustments.

 This makes us valuable for maintaining the aircraft

"The panthers were built as guard robots to protect
 military bases, and we have deployed them here.
 Please be very careful in their presence, as their
 claws can be lethal.

 There are also a few which have been upgraded to
 higher intelligence.  They make good companions,
 but I don't believe we have any such panthers here.

 Oh, and there are also some rogue units in the
 forest.  My brother, L-UPN has been trying to
 encourage them to return."

 Argus sent me to spy on the humans.  After all, that

 Unfortunately, I was captured by the Church.
 I thank you deeply for rescuing me!"

"I learned some interesting things, though I'm not sure
 they will be useful in our struggle against the Church
 hegemony.

 Despite the Church's insistence that modern technology
 is sinful, they have two digital pipe organs.  This
 indicates that the cathedral has a power source beneath
 it, most likely a nuclear pile like the one powering
 our air bases."

"The dungeons beneath the cathedral are also of
 interest.  You have your usual assortment of prison
 cells, a torture chamber and execution equipment.

 But there is also a magical barrier leading somewhere
 more interesting.  If the Pope has a secret room full
 of forbidden technology, that's where it would be.

 It is likely that there is another entrance via his
 bedchambers, but I was captured there before I could
 find anything.  After this I was interrogated and
 beheaded.  Then you rescued me, or so I'm told!"
