 we have been drafted that role instead."

 and am capable of performing delicate adjustments.

 This makes us valuable for maintaining the aircraft

"The panthers are built as guard robots to patrol
 the bases, and attack intruders.  They are very well
 suited to this role, so I beg you take care in their
 presence.

 Some of them have been upgraded to high intelligence
 and make good companions.

 There are also some rogue units in the forest.  I have
 been trying to encourage them to return, but without
 success."

"Ah, yes.  They live in the forest, guarding a large
 pile of coins and other valuable artifacts, and will
 not leave it.

 Owing to the temporal anomalies that have occurred
 some years ago, they have been out there, guarding
 their precious treasure for over three hundred
 subjective years.

 I have helped refuel them and repair their systems
 during the anomaly."

"I had brought them crosswords and other puzzle
 games to try and keep them occupied during their
 long vigil.

 Truth be told, I suspect that they have NOT stayed
 entirely sane, and that their long abandonment
 is one of the reasons for their monomania regarding
 the treasure."

[page="anomaly"]

"Some kind of causal domain shear occurred.

 We do not fully understand what happened, but the
 net result is that the parts of the planet populated
 by the medieval humans experienced a faster rate of
 time than the rest of it.

 Every day that passed for us, was experienced as one year
 by the medieval territories.  The phenomenon persisted for
 exactly one year, during which the planet's rotation was
 altered to match precisely 360 days per calendar year.

 Unfortunately the panthers and their treasure were
 inside the boundary of such an anomaly."

"Two of us were brought to this world.
 I am L-TRK, and my brother is W-OLF, but he is
 missing and presumed dead.
 
 Argus sent him to spy on the humans.  Such missions
 are the purpose we were built for, after all.  And
 before you say that a shiny black wolf-man with
 glowing red eyes isn't stealth, I must stress that we
 are equipped with invisibility field generators.

 However, this appears to have been insufficient as he
 never returned and we are convinced he was captured.

 Argus is hoping we can send someone to investigate...
 If his head is returned here, we should be able to
 reactivate him.  But I cannot go myself - without him
 I am the last one able to repair my fellows here."
