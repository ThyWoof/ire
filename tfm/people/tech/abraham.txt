You see a frightened-looking monk.  He starts as you
enter the room, and slowly edges away from you.

You see Father Abraham.  He starts as you enter the room,
but recognising you, calms down again.

"My name is Father Abraham.  I was the vicar of the
 church at New Leuchars before it was destroyed!"

[colour="#808080"]
He buries his face in his hands at the memory.

"I have no job nor home anymore.  My entire flock was
 slain at the massacre!  I fear that I am the sole
 survivor of the village, after the LORD rained down
 His anger upon it!"

[colour="#808080"]
He trails off.

"It was a prosperous village.  We had a thriving trade in
 cloth, wool and thread.  But it seems that many of my
 flock did also secretly trade with the Demons, providing
 them with food and clothings.

 It may also have been that the Demons did turn their
 minds away from the LORD, for my tithings fell, and
 fewer did come to Mass than before.  I knew that this
 would anger the LORD, but never did I expect to see what
 then happened!"

He looks at you with an expression of terror, and his
words come out in a babble.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"The Lord Jesus Christ appeared in the midst of our
 village.  With a smile and a wave he destroyed the
 entire village!  I alone survived!

 These Demons that I thought the children of Satan have
 given me food and a bed.  They have tended my wounds
 and shown great compassion, not at all like the fell
 monsters that the Church warned us of!

 It seems to me now as if the LORD is filled with cruelty
 and malice, and His enemies kind and merciful!

 I know not what to believe!"

 It is blasphemous!"

"It was a rhyme!  A horrible rhyme!  He stood amid the
 burning houses and the bodies of the dead, and He was
 laughing at the carnage!  But then He said:

 "Jesus is the Dark One, Jesus is the LORD,
  Jesus puts the heretics to fire and the Sword!"

 And then He saw me, and I feared greatly for my life,
 but He faced me, and said:

  "See to it that no man hears of this."

 And then, with more laughter, He faded away!"

"He looked exactly like He does on our crucifixes, but He
 was glowing!  His body was luminous and slightly
 transparent as if He was a ghost.. But He was solid,
 for He handed me a small piece of parchment, which 
 bore the words 'MATTHEW 10:34'.

 I know the litanies of the Bible by heart, and I know
 this verse.  It is something that Jesus Himself said to
 His disciples:

 "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to Earth.
  I have come not to bring peace, but war.

  I shall set man against father, daughter against
  mother, and the in-laws too shall fight each other."

 I have seen this with my own eyes!"

"It was a rhyme!  A horrible rhyme!  He stood amid the
 burning houses and the bodies of the dead children, and
 He laughed at the carnage!

 And then He said:

 "Jesus' hands are kind hands, Jesus' hands are cruel,
  Jesus is ingenious, Jesus is a fool,

  Jesus is the Dark One, Jesus is the LORD,
  Jesus puts the heretics to fire and the Sword!"

 And then He saw me, and I feared greatly for my life,
 but He faced me, saying:

  "See to it that no man hears of this."
