"Why, yes.  But I WAS!"

 Many years ago, the Cardinal took offence to me talking
 to my little friends, and I was burned as a witch.

 But the LORD must have found great favour with me, for
 I am risen again!  And the Pope has canonised me.

 So I am now a living Saint.."

"Why, the hawks and the crows are my friends!
 The foxes and the woolves that come to scavenge..

 They say it is good manners to talk while you eat, so
 I go every day to the graveyard to converse with them."

"How can it be bad?  They are God's creatures, and few
 enough have love for them.

 They are only eating the dead, as who have no use for
 their bodies anymore.  Is it not selfish to keep
 something you do not need from those who can make good
 use of it?

 I will gladly share MY body with the hawks and the
 woolves the next time I die."

"Indeed.  And they can understand what I say.
 But there are few indeed that the Lord has blessed with
 such ability.

 The only other I can remember was Brother Dolittle, and
 he's dead now."
