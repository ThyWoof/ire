"I am a copyist here at the Abbey.

 Our library hosts the finest collection of scrolls and
 codices in the world, and so we often get orders for
 copies of some of them.

 And, of course, there are always new works being written
 so copies of those must be made that they may be added
 to our library."

"I read the original tome line by line, and so write it
 into the copy.  When I have finished each page, they
 are given to one of the Illuminators, who copy the
 illustrations.

 The finished pages are then given over to the binders."

"There are thousands of codices in the library.
 It contains the sum of human knowledge that has been
 committed to vellum.

 The emphasis is, of course, upon the teachings of the
 Trinity, but there are also a number of pagan fables and
 the dark teachings of the Infidels.

 If you wish to read a codex, ask the Librarian or his
 assistant, and they will assist you."

"There are many great secrets in those teachings.
 Part of our Order's purpose is to separate the
 wonders they have known from the evils that would
 corrupt our society and bring down the wrath of
 the LORD upon us.

 If you wish to read a codex, ask the Librarian or
 his assistant, and they will assist you."

"No.  It is not permitted to enter the library, by order
 of the Abbot.

 There are many dark secrets in the library.
 Only a few are allowed to go in. The librarian, of
 course, and his assistant.  The Abbot, and a few others,
 high in the ranks of our Order.
 
 But no-one else may."

"It is a life of dedication to the LORD.. we are directly
 His servants.
 
 Our life is simple, and it can be hard at times.
 But being in the service of the LORD, we have greater
 access to His wonders, and the sure knowledge that we
 shall get our reward in Heaven when our lives on Earth
 be done."
