"I am an Illuminator.  I illustrate scrolls with
 decorative letters and drawings in the margins.

 When we make copies of existing works for the pilgrims,
 or of texts which are not already in our library, it is
 my job to faithfully copy the illuminations of the
 original onto the new text."

[page="copied"]

"There are many reasons why the texts should be copied.
 Vellum does not last forever, and so we must make
 duplicates of aging scrolls to prevent their wisdom
 from being lost to the ages.

 Pilgrims also visit the Abbey for the sake of our 
 library, and they often wish to purchase copies of the
 scrolls and codices that we hold.
 And there are ever new works being written.. copies of 
 these are to be added to the library as well."

"The library is our Abbey's collection of tomes and
 scrolls.  It contains many thousands of works, making
 it one of the wonders of the world!

 Pilgrims come from all around to see the texts from our
 library, and buy copies which can be made for them
 during their stay.

 If you desire a text, ask the librarian or his 
 assistant.  They should be able to help you."

"I fear that no-one is allowed to enter the library
 itself but a few high acolytes.

 If you wish to read a text, ask the librarian and he
 will assist you.

 The library contains many texts and secrets, not all
 of which are wholesome.  Some would anger the LORD
 Himself if they were widely read.  The librarian, and 
 his assistant can decide which texts are evil and may 
 not be read."

[page="evil"]

"Nothing 'happens' to them.  The library holds both truth
 and error.  But the librarian and his superiors must,
 from time to time, prevent a work from being read by any
 but the most enlightened.

 Sometimes, where a work contains both good and evil the
 good parts may be copied from it so they may be read by
 all without fear of evil or corruption.

 But even the most vile works must be preserved for
 future eyes to study.  The librarian and his assistant 
 often work upon such copies when there is naught else to
 do, and they are always chosen from the most skillful 
 copyists."
