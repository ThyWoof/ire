"I am a copyist of the Abbey library.
 I copy the text of works from our library so that
 visitors may take away a copy of the work if they
 wish it.

 Such copies obviously take a long time, and must be
 arranged in advance or sent to their buyer afterwards.

 In my spare time, I study the paradox of the duality
 of Christ.  I am writing a treatise on this topic."

"Our Saviour took the form of a man, but as the
 Son of God, great powers of the LORD were bestowed
 upon him, and it is by such means that he performed
 the slaying of the swine, the fig-tree, and the
 destruction of the Temple as described in the book
 of Darthinia.

 There has always been debate as to whether Jesus
 was a man, or a god, or something in between."

"The LORD moves in mysterious ways.  He told us that we
 had to decide for ourselves, and then remained silent.

 When I prayed to the crucifix for enlightenment, the
 Icon of our Saviour Crucified told me that the matter
 was personal and reminded me of the eighth deadly sin
 of Inquiry."

 book of Darthinia in my cell, if you wish to read it.

 It tells of the means by which the Lord cleansed the
 temple of sinners.  It truly was an awesome event."

"The library is our Abbey's collection of tomes and
 scrolls.  It contains many thousands of works,
 making it one of the wonders of the world!

 Pilgrims come from all around to see the texts from
 our library, and buy copies which can be made for
 them during their stay.

 If you desire a text, ask the librarian or his
 assistant.  They should be able to help you."

"I fear not.  For the more times a text is handled,
 the shorter it will survive.

 Also, there are texts among the collections of the
 library that are unholy.  You see, there are some things
 that mankind is not meant to know.. at least, not all of
 mankind.  Were such secrets known by others than those
 whom the LORD has chosen for such knowledge, the Trinity
 would be angered and many men would be cleansed.

 For these reasons, the Librarian and certain other
 acolytes are allowed to enter the library itself, but no
 others are.  You may ask the librarian for a book if you
 desire to read something."
