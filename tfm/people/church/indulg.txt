 How would you like to be free of all your sins
 in the eyes of the Lord?
 
 I have the means to achieve this, straight from
 the Pope himself!  I am one of the few authorised
 dealers of Papal Indulgences."

"I have here a collection of Papal Indulgences
 signed by the Holy Father himself.

 I have partial indulgences for a wide range of
 sins, and also a few plenary indulgences which
 absolve you of all your crimes, even those not
 yet committed!

 ... gluttony 600
 ... vanity 600
 ... inquiry 600

 ... sins of the flesh 1000
 ... abominations 2000

 ... theft 10000
 ... murder 20000
 ... plenary indulgence 50000"

"Perhaps not for yourself, but how about a deceased
 friend or relative?  Indulgences bought in their
 name will speed up their passage through Purgatory
 or even free them straight to Heaven!
 
 As the coin in the coffer rings,
 Another soul to Heaven springs.."
