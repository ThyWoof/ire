"Greetings, brother.  I am Father Malcolm.

 When I walk alone, the LORD often descends from Heaven
 and talks to me.  He tells me of the evils that plague
 our land.

 Long have I walked with God, and he has shown me many
 great things.  Soon he will show me the greatest thing
 of all..."

"Some years ago the LORD told me of the evil of the
 Demons which lurk to the south of this town, and that
 none would rise to fight them.

 In His name I travelled as a pilgrim, with a band of
 warrior monks to seek this evil out and banish it by the
 power of Jesus Christ.
 
 The LORD led me to the town of New Fairford, where the
 men and women were corrupt and worshippers of devils.
 When I told them of my holy errand, they laughed to my
 face and refused me shelter.

 The LORD waxed wroth and summoned a terrible beast to
 slay the unbelievers.
 
 We did march on, and I confronted the Demons alone.
 They took me prisoner, but I had my faith to comfort me,
 and the LORD freed my bonds.
 
 We slew many pawns of Satan that night, but the Dark One
 is not easily vanquished, and the Demons still roam free,
 though many of their worshippers now burn in Hell."

"The Demons are evil.  They are not God's creatures but
 works of darkness and sin.
 They can fly through the air as they wish, breathing
 fire and death upon the faithful.

 But worst of all, they tempt men to worship them with
 their promises of shelter, food and magic.

 Worshippers that win their highest favour are taught to
 perform certain of their magics by themselves, without
 need for praying to the LORD!

 We cannot let demons tempt men away from the path of the
 Trinity, for this angers the LORD.  Yet we cannot slay
 the demons either; the LORD has warned us that it is
 useless to try.  So we must kill their followers and
 save the souls of others before they can be seduced by
 the false promises of an easy life."

Stop the page.  This is used instead of just "exit" because a link
