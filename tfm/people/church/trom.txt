 You see a very stern-looking Cardinal.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Greetings, my $Son.  I am Cardinal Trom.

 I hear by way of the Holy Spirit that you are sent among
 us and go with the blessings of the LORD.

 Yet merciful though the Trinity are, I confess I do not
 trust you.
 I shall watch you as hawks do, and if you prove false, I
 shall strike you down with vengeance faster than the
 LORD Himself could deliver.

 Now.  What did you wish to speak with me about?"

"Welcome back, my $Son.

 What brings you before my presence?"

 The Cardinal's already grim expression darkens as he
 begins the Mass.  He points a finger accusingly at the
 congregation, who begin to cower.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Children... as you have now witnessed, the fate of Sodom
 and Gomorrah has fallen upon the unrepentant.
 The sinners who did dwell in the village of New Leuchars
 have been put to justice by the Holy Trinity.

 I know, and the LORD knows, that many here among you are
 equally guilty of the heinous crimes that the men of
 New Leuchars did perpetrate.

 Many of you here do also deserve the slow and painful
 death that has been meted out unto their earthly bodies
 and which they endure still in Hell."

"It would be just for the LORD Himself to appear and
 claim that penalty from you this very day, yet He has
 decided in His wisdom and mercy to spare your worthless
 lives in the hopes that the sight of His anger delivered
 unto others may turn you back to the path of the
 righteous and the just.

 I personally do not understand this undue clemency for I
 know that you are all heathen scum who deserve to burn
 for your treacherous dealings with Daemons and witches.

 But the LORD is our God, and He has commanded that your
 lives be spared for now.  His will be done."

"Be thankful that the LORD is merciful, and know that
 your do souls teeter upon the brink of the abyss of
 Hell itself!

 A single mistake and you shall fall.. an eternity of
 torment awaits all who would do deals with the foul
 enemies of the LORD and His son Christ, and the
 Holy Ghost.  Heed well these words!"

[colour="#808080"]
 The Cardinal pauses for a moment, allowing his words
 to sink in.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"The Mass is ended.
 Go, my children, and pray for your worthless souls."

We should have a check and cause Trom to explode if you
talk to him with a Waarg party member present.
If you have JMAC, and JMAC is provoked into speaking, you
will be similarly damned.

 Cardinal Trom's eyes narrow to two slits.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"You desecrate the house of the LORD by using that name!

 It is one of the names of the False One, Ba'al-Zebub,
 the Lord of Lies and Prince of Darkness!

 You must have been dealing with the hounds of Hell to
 learn of their false god!"

"You expect truth from these foul creatures?  Fool!

 Know that the LORD Himself has decreed that they are our
 enemies.  If any man be caught trading with them, his
 punishment shall be one of death.

 However, His Son speaks occasionally of compassion, and
 so I shall inform no-one of your crime.  However, if you
 are caught trading with servants of Evil again, your
 blood shall be upon you.

 Now be on your way."

 This wretched creature dares gainsay the Holy Trinity!

 What shall its punishment be?"

 Cardinal Trom looks at you critically and then relaxes.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Then know this.  Aa'R.. - the False One - is worshipped
 by devils in the form of woolves.  These hell-hounds do
 dwell in the south-east and they are fell creatures
 who make dark sacrements to the Evil One.

 The LORD has decreed that they are our enemies.  If any
 man be caught trading with them, his punishment shall be
 one of death.

 Now go, and trouble me no more."

"I have had men watching you, waiting for you to slip
 and fall.  Their diligence has now been rewarded.

 You have been seen entering other people's homes and
 looting their property.

 You have been seen to raise a man from the grave using
 fell witchcrafts.

 And, you have been seen consorting with the Evil One
 itself in person!  Who knows what dread bargains the
 pair of you have struck!
 For the safety of the Realm itself, you must burn!

 A witch!!  This $man must burn!"
