"Greetings, my $Son.  I am Cardinal De'Ath.

 The LORD has told me to expect your arrival to our

 will help you as best I can."

"Of course.  My predecessor angered the LORD and I have seen
 His will carried out on Earth.  Christ himself has spoken to
 me as has the Holy Ghost.  I would be a fool to disbelieve
 in the Trinity after this."

"I was, until recently, a priest.

 My predecessor was Cardinal Bas, who until recently
 resided here at Avis.  However, the LORD entrusted him with
 some most sacred duty in which he had failed.  I know not
 what this task was, but he failed and the LORD, very
 greatly displeased, smote him down with holy fire.

 I happened to be nearby at the time and the LORD commanded
 me to take his place, which I try to do.

 Cardinal Bas' personal effects are in a chest in my
 home, I have not yet had time to examine them."

Cardinal De'Ath shakes his head.

"I do not wish to speak of this.  Suffice it to say
 that Aa'Ruuff is a false god worshiped by the Dark
 Woolves of the east.

 They are not to be trusted and it is forbidden to
 treat with them."

The Cardinal looks appalled at your presence.

"The LORD has informed us of your sins, my $Son, and
 made it clear that you are no longer welcome in
 the House of God.

 Pray, leave immediately before the LORD destroys
 you!  I have no wish to witness His anger again!"
