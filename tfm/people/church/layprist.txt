"I assist the Bishop in the Mass, tend the candles, and
 watch over the church during the night.

 It is not a most taxing or rewarding job, but it pleases
 the LORD and this gives me fulfilment."

"The Church exists to separate the people from the 
 searing might and majesty of the LORD, before Whose gaze
 men would whither and die.

 We carry out the LORD's wishes on Earth and so please
 Him.

 Were we not to please Him, He would be angered and raze
 the Land in His mercy, as has happened in the past, and
 also more recently in lands where people held their God
 in contempt.

 They are dead now, as a warning to all."
