"Ah-h, $PLAYERNAME.  The LORD has told me much about you,
 but I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting you
 face-to-face.

 I am the Pope, as well you know.. the first, and most
 trusted of the LORD's servants since His return.

 You may address me as 'Your Holiness'.  But first, the
 LORD bade me deliver a message to you, and a warning."

"I know that you are likely confused as to how you ended
 up in this realm, and uncertain as to what to do.

 I can reveal that you were brought here to this land,
 as part of the divine plan.
 You see, the LORD  believes you may be the one foretold,
 who will finally rid us of the scourge of the Demons."

"The LORD moves in mysterious ways, and it is not for us
 to question His ineffable wisdom.  He desires a tool to
 rid the land of evil, and we must be content with that.

 That said, it occurs to me that the sight of a human
 conquering the inhuman may rally our divine cause, and
 ensure peace is finally brought to the world."

"Approach your task as you see fit, but know that the
 LORD has shared this wisdom: You owe Him big.

 By rights, leaving your own land should have killed you.
 It was the LORD who brought you here, moulding the
 fabric of reality itself to save you from a painful
 death in the cold vacuum of space.

 It is by His command that the Church has shown you
 leniency for sins which have seen others beheaded.

 All this was done that you may serve His will.
 It is for this reason that the LORD has spared you, and
 He expects to be repaid for this act of mercy.
 Ignore His wishes at your peril."

"For many thousand years the LORD has dreamed of a
 perfect world, one dedicated entirely to His worship,
 where only Good can be permitted to exist.

 There have been a number of attempts before.
 Adam and Eve were merely prototypes, a trial run.
 They failed the LORD and had to be destroyed.

 Moses led the first true attempt at dominion, but again
 the people rebelled and rejected the way of the LORD.
 Millions were terminated in the LORD's displeasure."

 edge of the sword shall cow the nonbelievers and add
 them to our ranks.

 None shall resist.  This time we will not fail."

 The LORD Himself walks among us again, through His
