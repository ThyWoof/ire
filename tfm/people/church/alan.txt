"I am a priest of the Trinity.  Oft the Saviour has
 preached of the evil woolves to the East, and warned
 men not to stray there.
 
 Yet we are forbidden to slay them, for the LORD is
 merciful and looks to their ultimate redemption
 in His sight.

 So I did go in a sacred quest to convince these
 furry heathens of their error, and to set aside
 their evil ways.

 It did not end well."

"The Church exists to separate the people from the 
 searing might and majesty of the LORD, before Whose gaze
 men would whither and die.

 We carry out the LORD's wishes on Earth and so please
 Him.

 Were we not to please Him, He would be angered and raze
 the Land in His mercy, as has happened in the past, and
 also more recently in lands where people held their God
 in contempt.

 They are dead now, as a warning to all."
