"Welcome, my $Son.  My name is Cardinal Tod.

 I apologise that I could not make the journey to
 New Highworth, but my ankle is sprained and I cannot
 travel.

 The LORD has commanded me to tell you of our faith, and
 of the battle against evil.  The End is growing near."

 The Cardinal adopts a speaking voice and addresses his
 congregation.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"The wise do say, 'Knowledge is Power', and this is true.
 But though knowledge is Power, it be a dangerous Power:
 one that can assist the Evil One in its plotting 'gainst
 the Trinity and holy mother Church.

 Therefore, it is our holy duty to maintain and protect
 this knowledge, and to safeguard it against those whom
 the LORD does not wish it to become known to.
 And yes, to protect indeed the common man from the
 burden and corruption that this knowledge would bring.

 Brothers, I say to you now that the LORD and Christ have
 told to me that they are well pleased with our
 performance in this task."

"Yes, my $Son.  The LORD does talk to His children.  He
 will come down from Heaven as a glowing ball of flame..
 it is a most wondrous sight.  But this happens rarely.
 Usually His word shall be sent through the Holy Ghost,
 who takes the form of a bird for His messages.

 But if the Simple have committed sins against His law,
 the Holy Ghost may appear in the form of a beast to
 slay the unbelievers."

 The trumpets of the apocalypse shall sound and the war
 of Good against Evil will enter the final stage!

 the pit, and the forces of darkness roam free!"

 It is unfortunate, but it cannot be helped for it is the
 Will of the LORD, that we are in the last days.

 The War of Good and Evil is being waged.  Imps and demons
 do manifest themselves.  The forces of Evil are at hand!

 How long we have is not known, and the LORD will not
 say.  But be sure that when the time comes, the faithful
 shall be led unto paradise!"

The Cardinal sighs.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"He is something of a burden upon us.

 He has tamed many woolves, and they follow him around,
 even to Mass.  Once we attempted to slay the beasts,
 but they rose again and continued to follow him!

 For this and his many unorthodox beliefs, Francis was
 burned at the stake.  But the LORD must have found great
 favour in him, for like the woolves, he arose from the
 grave where his ashes were placed!

 He arrived at Mass that day as if nothing had happened,
 and the icon of our Saviour Crucified spoke and told us
 not to try and burn him again!

 He was canonised by the Holy Father under orders
 straight from the Lord God.  We dare not refuse him
 shelter, even though his animals are a strain upon us."
