  A Chinese domestic flight was hijacked at about
  4:30 UTC on Monday and diverted to United Korea.

  The man, who claimed to have explosives, gave
  himself up and was detained by the authorities.

  Attempts to return the passengers to China were
  complicated when the airliner requested asylum.
