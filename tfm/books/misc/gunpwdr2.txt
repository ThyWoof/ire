 Bishop Ludwig,

 Find enclosed the signed contract proposed by Redtooth.
 The LORD approves greatly of a change in king, for Grey's
 brother has proven more shrewd than anticipated.

 Naturally, copies have been retained in the archives here, both in
 our tongue and Waargish.  These will prove useful in the event
 that Redtooth should ever need to be replaced in his turn.

 For the glory of the LORD, Amen

     Pope Harris
