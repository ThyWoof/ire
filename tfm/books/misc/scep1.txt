  Darett,

  My principals are willing to pay you ten and a half thousand
  gold coins for obtaining it.  We can't conceal that amount
  easily so it will have to be paid in installments.  To help
  make up for this I think we can also buy you a plenary
  indulgence for crimes you haven't even committed yet.
  
  Once it has been acquired there will be an outcry, so lie low.
  Let no-one even SUSPECT you have it and do NOT leave it
  unattended.  Keep it about your person at all times until I
  come to collect it.  Eat with it, wash with it, even sleep
  with the thing.  Feel free to dispose of anyone who strays
  too close.  Remember, no-one will be able to save you if it
  is found in your keeping.
  
  I shall return in a fortnight with the first part of your
  reward.  I am confident you will have secured it by then and
  there should also have been time for the uproar to die down.

  Jorge
