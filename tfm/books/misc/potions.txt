  Farwell's Book of Potions

  It is known, by mixing various hearbs with the
  wisdom given us by the LORD, that potions may be
  brewed that heal or otherwise provide aid to the
  one who drinks thereof.

  Yellow potions do heal the drinker, while those
  red in colour are a sovereign cure for poisons.

  Potions that are green should not be taken, lest
  the drinker be poisoned.  As mentioned, a red
  potion shall suffice to cure you should you have
  consumed one in error.

  Potions blue in colour shall put the drinker into
  a refreshing sleep.

  Potions that are white do allow the drinker to see
  in darkness.

  Some say that there are also potions which are black,
  and these do hide the drinker from the sight of
  others.  These be most rare and expensive, for theeves
  may find them of great use during their sinful deeds.

  It is wise not to consume too many potions of diverse
  effect too quickly, for combined, they may do ill unto
  the drinker.

  In the next volume, we shall look at how such potions
  may be brewed.
