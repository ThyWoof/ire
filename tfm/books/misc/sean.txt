  The Tale of Sean
  
  By [Invent some alias for Sofox here]

  Sean was but a peasant boy who dreamed of being an
  adventurer.  However he was a scrawny youth, and lacking of
  any significant sense of strategy or battle tactics.  It was
  said that he was fair game for anyone much larger than his
  sister.

  Yet Sean did not lose heart - he sought a magical artifact so
  powerful it could make up for all his shortcomings.  He had
  heard tell of the legendary Crystal Swords, blades forged by
  a master glassmaker in ancient times long past.  So powerful
  were they, that they could fell any foe with but a single stroke.

  But Sean had no idea where such a sword may be found, so
  many long years were spent in quest of one.  Some say that it
  was more luck then anything else that led him to stumble upon
  a Crystal Sword in a dark cave some years later.

  Exhilarated, Sean returned home to find that the King had
  chosen to tour Sean's very village.  "The LORD smiles upon me,"
  he said, and drew out the blade.

  Confronting the monarch, Sean yelled, raising the blade high in
  his hand.  "Your reign comes to an end!  You have taxed the
  people to poverty, and many honourable men have died by your
  hand!"

  The monarch set his heavily armoured guards on Sean, and Sean
  did swing his sword at one of them. There was a shattering
  sound, a blinding flash of light, a release of tremendous
  energy and the guard did fall dead before his eyes.

  "So you did have the Crystal Sword," said the monarch amazed,
  "but why did you use it upon that guard instead of me?"

  "Use it...?" Sean looked at his sword and saw to his horror
  that the entire blade was shattered, leaving only the hilt in
  his grip with only a few shards of crystal sticking from it.

  "The Crystal Sword is said to be a truely devastating weapon,"
  the monarch continued, "But legend says that it can give but
  one blow, in which it is destroyed.  Did you not know...?"

  Sean was about to answer but his reply was cut off by the
  sword of another guard cutting off his head.

  As Sean's head rolled along the dust, his grip loosened, and the
  broken hilt fell and hit the ground.

  "A pity," said the monarch. For a moment he considered collecting
  the hilt as a momento, but thought better of it, and ordered his
  procession unto the next village.
