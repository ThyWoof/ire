  For the Promised One

  On the advice of the Church and my own counsel, I have
  ordered prepared for you a house, to the northeast of the
  Church where the astrologers say you will arrive.
  A key should be given with this note that will let you in.

  In the house you should find items of use, such as a sword
  to defend yourself if you should seek to travel, some coins
  of the realm, and some provisions.

  For the safety of our people there is a curfew imposed at
  the hour of eleven.  Beasts walk abroad at night and it is
  not safe outside, even when armed.  A bed is provided that
  you may sleep away these unsafe hours.

  I ask that you respect this and other laws of the realm.
  
                               King Edwyg the Generous
