  Ambrose,

  I fear you misunderstand the situation.  While I do not fault
  your enthusiasm, the LORD Himself is displeased by your
  attempts to dispose of the remains and has commanded me to
  investigate the situation.  Be grateful that this chastisement
  comes only from me and not from Him in person!

  Yes, when the head comes off a man, his life is ended - yet it
  is not always so with demons.  This creature can yet be revived
  by those skilled in such arts and the LORD will wish to
  interrogate him again in future.

  You will therefore disinter the head IMMEDIATELY and see that
  it is kept safe.  It should fit inside our records cabinets, so file
  it there until a more permanent place can be agreed upon.

  Please do this with all haste, for your actions anger the LORD.
  
  By order of the Holy Trinity,

     Pope Harris
