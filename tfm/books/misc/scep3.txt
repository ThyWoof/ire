  Cardinal Bas,

  It has been has told to me that we shall give the King until
  January to deliver the outstanding tributes to Our LORD.
  If by that time he still has not given to us His due, we
  shall have to proceed with the plan we have discussed.
  
  Personally I feel that he is unlikely to comply, so I would
  suggest you make advance preparations for this project and
  find suitable agents to carry out the acquisition.

  Do not forget - the tribute is for the LORD's greater glory
  and He greatly desires it.  If it becomes necessary for
  blood to be spilled, then that is a price He is willing to
  pay.  Success is imperative - or you shall explain why the
  tribute is not made to the LORD Himself, in person.
  
  By order of the Holy Trinity,

     Pope Harris
