 On behalf of the Church, I do give thanks to King
 Redtooth for the supply of 50 barrels of military-grade
 blasting powder.

 We have now accepted the initial shipment, my men shall
 return soon to collect the second half of our order and
 bring the outstanding the gold ingots.

   Cardinal Bas,
   on behalf of His Holiness, Pope Edward Harris the Just

(a parchment in English detailing a sale of n barrels of military
 gunpowder to the Church in exchange for 18 ingots of pure gold.

 SteelJaw can't read English.. by custom only Kings are permitted
 to know the human writings.

 You can't present this as proof to the court because only the
 King can read it and he'll simply deny it.
 The only other living Waarg who can read English is Swiftrunner
 and he's been exiled and cannot enter the city by law.

 SteelJaw reasons that if the Church is involved they should
 have some Waargish documents incriminating them.  Since you
 can't read Waarg yourself, you'll need a Waarg to help you locate
 the documents.

 Swiftrunner won't join you, but one of SteelJaw's men will.
 When you meet King Grey, he will join.. you must have him
 to log in to the systems anyway.

When you find the documents they reveal that RedTooth sold out
to Xy'Lan.. betraying King Grey in exchange for the Throne.
This will be enough to oust Redtooth.. or you can lead King
Grey back to the Waarg city and overthrow the King directly)
