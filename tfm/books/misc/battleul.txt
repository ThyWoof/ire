                Chronicles of the Battle of Ul

                        Captain Rimach


  In the year 1310, our people heard the calling of the LORD
  to do battle with the forces of darkness and sin that lurk
  in the far east of the lands.

  On the morning of the thirteenth of the month of November,
  the LORD GOD did descend from Heaven to the church at the
  cathedral of New Avignon, and spoke to our Holy Father the
  Pope of the evils being done in the far-off land of Ul.

  The LORD commanded all present to rise up in arms and
  cleanse the land of the dark children of Belial.  And the
  Icon of our Lord Christ Crucified did speak in all the
  churches throughout the length of the land, echoing this
  holy commandment from God.

  We did go to war and after many weeks of travel, found the
  valley by the desert of Ul where those dogs of hell did live.

  Our enemies fought like the devils of hell itself, and the
  battle lasted for many moons.  Many of our men fell in battle,
  and yet most few enemies were taken with them.

  It looked to be the hour of our defeat, when the LORD God
  intervened by sending an Angel to slay their leader.  Once this
  was done, their legions scattered.  But the LORD did not
  deliver their armies to us as He did in the book of Judges,
  for our victory was short-lived and they found a new leader.

  About this time, the LORD told us that he was pleased with us
  and commanded that we should return home with our wounded.
