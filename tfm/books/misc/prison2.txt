         The Diary of Governor Wirral

  26th March 1324 
  Woke up with a headache.  Hanged some urchin.  Felt better.

  27th March 1324
  Church wanted some guy strung up.  Decided to leave it a few
  days.

  30th March 1324
  Forgot to have the prisoners fed yesterday.  Hope the guards
  remembered.

  1st April 1324
  The LORD appeared before me and demanded to know why the
  guy they sent me Wednesday was still alive.. whoops.
  Told Him that I was going to let Ingram loose on him for a
  bit first.  Gave him to Ingram for a little pre-hanging
  warm-up which the LORD found most amusing.  Hanged him.
  The LORD was pleased.
