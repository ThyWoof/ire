                  The Book Of Fish

              By Munrick The Unstable


 [ This tome describes various kinds of fish.
   It explains what each fish looks like, tastes like, smells like
   and sounds like.

   Particular attention is paid to the mating song of the yellow
   swamp-trout, which supposedly has handles that enable it to
   be carried around.

   Later chapters describe the Great Man'O'War of Ub, which
   according to Munrick is shocking pink, has tentacles up to
   twenty kilometers in length and is able to fly. ]
