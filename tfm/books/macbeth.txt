                   MacBeth - Abridged Version

                     By William Shakespeare



 Macbeth: Have some more of my Beautiful Drink, guards,
          for I have slain King Duncan and now I must
          wipe his blood on you!


 And thus began the glorious reign of Macbeth, King of Scotland!
