"Much as it pains me to sieze power in a military coup,
 the man you chose by yourselves to be your leader has
 proven himself to be wholly evil."

"As a result it has unfortunately become necessary to
 correct the actions of the government using the means
 described in the US constitution."

"Congress will remain responsible for the day-to-day
 running of the country.  Preparations shall begin
 immediately for fresh elections.  Supreme executive
 power will be held by myself and the Airforce One twins
 until a replacement president has been chosen."
