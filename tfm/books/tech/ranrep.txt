          Status Report 93

 Randolph
 ________
 No positive progress has been made in locating
 Randolph.  Sherlock and Watson have made a
 number of sweeps over the forest area and we
 should have been able to locate him by now if
 he was outside in the open.  The conclusion is
 that he must be somehow concealed.

 Connectivity
 ____________
 Communications with the other bases are still
 jammed, although Austin did manage to obtain a
 few seconds of visual contact with Commander
 Argus of Security.  No further transmissions
 have been received from the saurians who
 remain unidentified.

 Magic
 _____
 Fisher and DeLuca have nothing new to report
 at this time although their researches are
 continuing.
