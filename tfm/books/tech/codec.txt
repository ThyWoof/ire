 King Grey hunkers down in front of the terminal, and all
 of Xy'Lan's training comes back to him.
 As his paws race, incomprehensible symbols and diagrams
 flash across the screen.
 Mere moments later, he has logged you into the system.

 You're logged into the most powerful computer system in
 the world.  But you can't understand the display.

"Excellent!  You've made it to the CODEC data terminal.

 Unfortunately, that is the easy bit.  Now we have to
 find some way to get into the system.

 Xy'Lan has changed the login, so you will need to find
 someone who knows the CODEC decryption key.  This will
 not be easy, but it would take us millenia to break it
 using brute-force.

 I would suggest you look through the Pope's papers and
 see if he has any record of the pass-codes."

"Fantastic.. now we're getting somewhere!

 Now, we need to install some new software on the
 machine.  I believe we have already given you the
 data cube containing the new program."

The program doesn't work.  You have to return to the
dragons to obtain an update.

 You stand before the most powerful computer system on
 the entire planet.

 But you have no idea how to use it.
