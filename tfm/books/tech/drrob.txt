print out a copy to take to the ospreys

 Read Milo's report of the destruction of New
 Leuchars.  Terrible business.  Whatever it is
 that the Church serve (or serves the Church) -
 it is vicious, powerful and has a very warped
 sense of humour.

 It has isolated us, with monsters infesting the
 forests and some kind of force wall boxing our
 aircraft into the surrounding area.  Our only
 means of contacting the other bases is on foot
 and there is no-one left to send.  I think the
 others are all dead.

 I should never have been left in charge, I'm a
 biologist, not a commander.

 My mind is made up.  I can't just sit here and
 wait.  I need to act - the only possibility I
 can see is the ospreys and their strange
 powers.
 If we can only learn to harness them ourselves
 it may give us a weapon to defend ourselves
 with.

 The birds are now intelligent enough to have
 built structures and have formed some kind of
 community.  I don't know how they will react
 if I approach them, but I will have to try.
 Maybe I can arrange some kind of alliance,
 crazy as it sounds.

 If you're reading this, I guess it didn't
 pan out.  Tell Milo and the others I'm sorry.
