"We are in luck!  This human-built computer has been
 hooked up to the Maxima's auxiliary processing systems.

 With this machine we should be able to modify the
 ship's engine controllers and get them to generate a
 counter-forcefield capable of negating the flight
 barriers.  If Xy'Lan has installed other forcefields
 to block your path we may be able to negate those too.

 Now, plug the communicator into the lap-top and we
 shall see what we can accomplish!"

 Commander Gurd reappears on the communicator shortly
 afterwards.

"We have a problem.  The engines are indicating an
 error condition.  You will have to go into the Maxima
 itself to rectify this.

 The entrance to the ship must be somewhere in this area,
 but it is likely to be protected by various human-built
 traps and devices.

 I had hoped to avoid this, but we will aid you if we
 can.  Good luck!"

"Ooh, interesting!  This human-built computer has been
 hooked up to the Maxima's auxiliary processing systems!

 Remember this place, mark it with an orb if you can,
 for we shall need you to return here as soon as Naavris
 has finished writing the new firmware we will need.

 Until then, distributing communicators to the air
 bases is a higher priority."
