  Holy Father,

  In accordance with your instructions, the heathen music device
  has been secured and interred upon an island far to the west.

  Should it become necessary to retrieve the machine, it may be
  found by the following means:

  There are two lakes upon the island, of these one has a rock
  to the north of it.  Heading west from this rock, a palm tree
  should eventually be found.  We have heaped stones beneath
  the appropriate tree and, assuming none have removed these
  in the intervening time, that is where one should dig.
  
  For the greater glory of the LORD,

     Cardinal Bas
