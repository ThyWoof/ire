               Warrior's Revolt

                   by Td. Nikki

 [ This is an account of the 'Warrior's Revolt'
  of 2029, in which an air campaign against
  Greece is brought to a halt when all the
  aircraft decide that the war is unjust and
  jettison their weapons.

  It then chronicles the founding of 'Haven', the
  aircraft state created by the defectors from
  the Allied coalition and the Greek airforce,
  and carries on up to the amendments of the
  Geneva Convention, and the official recognition
  of aircraft as being human-equivalent and
  protected by the newly-amended human rights
  legislation. ]
