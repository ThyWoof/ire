                 I am not me

               by Lj. Trillian

 [ This is Trillian's gripping bestseller
   about a renegade F-22 on the run from the
   law.
   The F-22 captures a learjet and with the
   help of his accomplices, swaps his own
   brain module with the learjet's.

   The learjet, now trapped in the F-22's
   old body, is captured and sentenced to
   death for the F-22's crimes.  He manages
   to break free before he can be executed,
   and is left on the run himself, in a grim
   and desparate bid to find the missing
   learjet to reclaim his true body, and save
   his own life.. ]
