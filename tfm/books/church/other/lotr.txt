               Lord of the Rings
            Lost Manuscript Series
                     Book 2


 This tome is reprinted from some of Tolkien's
 original notes before he had finalised the plot
 of his famous trilogy.

 This version departs from the original plot
 when the Council persuades Gwaihir Windlord to
 fly the One Ring to Mount Doom instead of
 sending two hobbits to do the job.

 The story ends apocalyptically as the One Ring
 approaches the place of its forging.  Gwaihir
 falls under its' spell and claims the Ring for
 his own, dethroning Sauron to replace him with
 a feathered Dark Lord.
