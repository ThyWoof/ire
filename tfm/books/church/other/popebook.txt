               The Diary of Edward Harris, Book I

 25th December 2110

 It is Christmas Day, but few have attended the Mass.
 The others have debased the holy day of our Lord's birth,
 thinking only of themselves and ignoring our Saviour.

 I walked alone tonight, to be free of them.  They do not know
 the inner peace that the Lord can provide to His servants.

 As I knelt to pray in the wilderness, a vision of the Lord God
 appeared before me.  These are the words that He said:

 "Edward Harris.  I have chosen you.

  I have lain dormant for eons, but it is the time of reawakening.
  On this world, My dominion shall be reestablished.
  The unfaithful shall be cast out of My sight."

 "You are a devout man, Edward, and you shall become Pope.
  The miracles you shall perform will be undreamt of, surpassing
  even those of Moses and Christ.  A Third Testament shall be
  written to chronicle the new era that is dawning, and you shall
  be at the helm, under My guidance.

  Return now to the village, and found a Church in My name.
  Assume the role of Bishop, for your Papacy is not yet at hand.
  Preach to the others of My return, and that of My Son, Christ.

  I grant you now eternal life, and the power to win over the
  faithless.  Go forth and preach.  We shall speak again soon."


 2nd February 2111

  By the strength that the Lord has given me, I have assumed the
  Throne of St. Peter, amid the jubilation of the Faithful.
  As the Pope, I can make any decree that pleases God, and the
  Faithful obey it with reverence.

  Those who do not accept divine rule have been cast out, as the
  Lord demands.  But they are fighting our rule, and with help
  from the Others it is a pitched battle.  But they will lose
  eventually.  The Lord wills it.


 9th May 1018 (2113 in the old calendar)

  In accordance with the Lord's wishes, I have decreed that the
  year henceforth be changed.  The Lord has revealed the error
  of the multitude; it is 1018 in the year of our Lord, and
  any who deny this shall be called a heretic.

  The Lord has also decreed that the twelve months be thirty
  days apiece, and so each year shall have 360 days in accord
  with the perfect harmony of the spheres.

  There were some who did disagree with this, but in the Lord's
  wisdom and mercy, they have been offered the chance to recant
  their error, lest they suffer the Lord's anger.

  The Lord has lead us to victory against the Others, whom He
  refers to as the Demons.  We have taken them by surprise and
  most of the Demons did fly away to another land.

  Though some Demons have not fled, the Lord is well pleased,
  and tells me that they pose no further threat.  Their worshippers
  are a far greater concern.

  Many of these infidel have surrendered, and sworn to serve the
  Lord.  Those who did not so swear have been put to the sword.


 20th June 1018

  The Lord has commanded that a new order be formed to protect
  our faith from the corruption of the infidel and unbelievers.
  This order is called the Protectorate, and they shall be trained
  as warrior monks to fight the evils of heresy.

 13th July 1018

  Just as the Lord commanded Ezekiel to raise an undead army,
  so too has He commanded me.  The bones of the heretics shall
  rise again, to serve the Lord more truly than they did when
  cloaked in flesh.  I find this pleasing.

  I have ordered the construction of a tower in the eastern lands.
  This shall be the site where the army shall be kept in readiness
  for the Second Coming.  The site I have chosen is close enough
  to the Dark Lands as to prevent casual intruders, yet we can
  leave nothing to chance, so a full defence mechanism shall be
  planned out and installed closer to the time that the tower
  approaches completion.
