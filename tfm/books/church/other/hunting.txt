              A treatise on the hunting of fowl
                    by Polak the Younger

  The thick forest in which we live is home also to a great many
  woodland creatures.  Common among these are fowl, chickens and
  grouse which make a fine stew if you can catch them.

  If you would hunt fowl, take a crossbow, or perhaps a falcon
  if you are versed in the art of hawking.

  Chickens make fine eating, and a single large bird can feed a
  family for several days.  Brown grouse are also good for their
  meat, and are highly prized.

  But there is a bird of the forest that you should NOT eat, the
  blackcock, the male black grouse.  The blackcock is evil, and
  has oft been seen performing vile acts of witchcraft at night.

  It was so decreed by a Cardinal that the blackcocks should be
  hunted down as agents of the Evil One, and for a while a
  bounty could be had for each blackcock slain.

  But this found disfavour with the LORD who revealed that the
  evil black grouse must mate with the fair brown grouse to raise
  her young, and the bounty was ended.
  
  You should leave the blackcock well alone during the day, and
  flee them if you be left in the forest after dark.
