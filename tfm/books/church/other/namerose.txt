                     The Name of the Rose
                        by Umberto Eco
                  Translated by William Weaver


 This is a novel set in a land where the Lord does not speak
 to His children and they are left to guess His will.

 At heart it is a mystery tale of murders in an abbey, and the
 vices which men of the cloth can fall prey to.
