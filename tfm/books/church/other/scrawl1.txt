     the terrible poison that gives purification

   the best weapon for destroying the enemy

     use humble persons, base and ugly, take pleasure from
      their defect

              they must not die

 not in the houses of the noble and the powerful but from the
  peasant villages, after abundant meal and libations

   squat bodies, deformed faces

           the venerable figs

    the shameless stone rolls over the plain

        before the eyes
