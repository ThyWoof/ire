 Papal Bull against Grand Heresy, 27th October 1319


 Of all the sins and heresies, there is none more evil than the
 lies of those who deny that the LORD is GOD.

 I refer, not to those who believe in other gods, but the infidel
 who claim that the LORD is not the One, the Only GOD.. those
 who deny that the LORD is creator of all things!

 The LORD, our God has spoken to me directly on this matter,
 and with the agreement of the rest of the Trinity, has exhorted
 that blasphemers who deny the Power and Might of our Heavenly
 Father, be taught the error of their ways by the Protectorate.

 This shall necessitate suffering, torment and the releasing of
 many souls, but it is the divine will of the LORD.
 Any man who questions this edict shall be called a heretic.

 For the glory of the LORD, Amen

     Pope Harris
