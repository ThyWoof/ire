                 Beasts of the Land, Vol II
                 by Chorley of New Avignon



 By the grace of the LORD, the world is inhabited by many
 varieties of beast.  By His hand, the beasts were released at the
 dawn of the world, to multiply and be fruitful.

 So it was that the beasts were given free reign over the world.
 Many beasts remained good and true, others strayed from the
 path and turned to the way of the Evil One.

 This volume concerns beasts which are considered unclean for
 food, and which may not be eaten.

 The Bear

 Bears are large, brown animals which
 give birth to their young through
 their mouths.  A she-bear will be
 pregnant for only thirty days, and so
 she gives birth to formless meats,
 which she will lick into the shape of
 cubs with her tongue over a period of several days.
 
 Bears may be dangerous, especially when they are in cub, and
 should be avoided when possible.


 The Secretary Bird

 There is a bird called the Secretary Bird, which has the body of
 a heron, and the head of a falcon.  The Secretary Bird will hunt
 small animals such as mice, which she kills by stamping upon
 them.

 Bees

 Bees are small insects.  When first born, they have no feet nor
 wings, but these grow after a time.   Bees live in wax hives and
 make honey from flowers.   Bees are born from the carcasses of
 dead cattle.  To make bees, slay an ox and leave the body for a
 few weeks.  Then flay the corpse and worms shall emerge which
 will later grow into bees.


 Todes

 Todes are large, dry frogs.  They have turned to the way of the
 Adversary, and it is known that they can act as the eyes and ears
 of the Evil One.  To assist in this work, the tode has the power
 to spit fire and poisons at any attacker if confronted.

 Todes are often used as familiars by those in the pay of Sathan,
 and they can help in the performing of hideous witchcraft.

 Each tode carries in his head a Todestone,
 a precious jewel of considerable power.
 The size of the Todestone determines its
 power, and the size depends on the age
 of the tode.  Todestones can be used for
 healing magics and also to ward off evil.
 
 
 The Ospray

 In the north, hawks are found which catch fish.  They are called
 Osprays.  They are brown and white, and circle the water until
 they see a fish, before diving in with a great splash.  At the
 last moment the Ospray will climb away, holding the fish.


 The Honey Buzzard

 There is a hawk called the Honey Buzzard, which does live in the
 depths of the forest, and eats bees.  This bird walks around

[font 3]
 the floor of the forest searching for wasps' nests or beehives,
 and she can also run if threatened.  When she finds a nest, the
 Honey Buzzard will break it open and eat the attacking insects.
 It is said that when a Honey Buzzard grows old, she will seek
 the rosehip bush, and eating the berries, becomes young again.


 Woolves

 There are found throughout the forests, woolves of many kinds.
 they are all large and grey, and may be dangerous if threatened.
 When the winter is bad, woolves may leave the forest and try to
 kill our livestock.  The LORD has revealed that this is a test
 to ensure we are ever vigilant for a surprise attack by the
 forces of Evil, and to keep us from the sin of complacency.

 Our LORD, who moves in mysterious ways, has also hinted that
 He made woolves to act as His emissaries and administer justice
 throughout the kingdom of beasts.  In view of this, it was
 decreed that if a man shall kill a woolf, the punishment shall
 be as if they had killed a guard of the city.

 The Cireth

 There is a beast known as the Cireth, which is like a large
 squirrel.  They live near the mountain lakes and hunt todes.

 The Cireth has no enemies except for mankind, and since they
 have no natural defences, the Cireth has been given an unnatural
 defence by the LORD.  If a Cireth becomes threatened, they will
 utter a prayer in a shrill voice, and an angel of the LORD
 shall be dispatched to assist them.


 The Blackcock

 In the forests are found large black grouse.

 They are known to gather in open parts of the
 forest where they call out and dance for the
 amusement of their Dark Master.  They are true
 servants of Evil and must be avoided at all costs for many have
 been found slain who strayed too close to where blackcocks live.
