                    Heresies and Schisms

                       by Cardinal Tod


 The Order of Christ the Servant

 This branch of our Church is not in itself a heresy, for they are
 but an order which chooses to focus upon the teachings of Christ
 in the book of John, in particular chapter 13, wherein our Lord
 Jesus Christ washes the feet of his disciples.

 But the Order attracted many sinners who took these teachings
 and used them for their own ends.   They soon broke away to
 form a Chapter of their own, and it is this Chapter which has
 fallen into blasphemy and sin.

 The Church of Christ the Slave, or as some say, 'Serpentists',
 is a heretical faction that takes the teachings of John:13 to
 mean that the power of Christ can be had by all, and it may
 be put to any task that man should desire.

 It is said that they do not worship Christ openly, nor God, nor
 the Holy Ghost, but the Virgin Mary in the form of a snake.
 And at Easter Mass they perform a ceremony to trap the spirit
 of our Lord Jesus in two bottles, that His power may be used
 in any way they list.

 When these evil deeds were uncovered by the Order of Christ the
 Servant, arms were taken against the heretics.  The Bishop of
 the Serpentists was burned alive for his crimes, and most of his
 followers were tortured and hanged.
 
 Yet some escaped, and it is said that this devilry is still
 practiced in dark and secret places.


 The Order of Jesus the Mighty

 This sect takes extreme views on the attitude of our Lord, and
 some refer to it as 'The Church of the Evil Jesus'.
 It subcribes to the heresy that God is responsible for all the
 evil and suffering in the World of Men.  They also claim that

[font 3]
 the Devil is merely one of the LORD's servants!

 And most blasphemously of all, they do claim that the Lord
 Jesus Christ committed many sins and much violence, which they
 revere, and that the second coming of Christ will result in the
 deaths of many Faithful at the hands of our Saviour!

 At one time this blasphemous den was rife, but the Protectorate
 was highly successful against those who would pervert the
 doctrines at the very heart of our Faith.  Any that do still
 live will certainly keep such blasphemous ideas very secret.
 

 The Church of Christ the Furry

 This sect did worship that which they did call the Lupus Christi,
 the Wolf of Christ.  They did worship the Saviour in the form of
 a man with a wolf's head and paws.

 Although unorthodox, this sect did keep the sacrements and the
 Trinity did ignore them until their leader proclaimed that the

[font 3]
 true form of man was that of a wolf.  Then did the Trinity lose
 patience, and the LORD punished them with a curse, setting them
 apart from the realms of both man and beast, ever to be lost
 between them, able to settle in neither.

 Some among the High Cardinals did press the LORD on this
 matter, saying that the Furries had got what they had wanted.
 To this the LORD said in His mysterious way, "Well, it got them
 out of our hair, didn't it?".
 To this day it remains unclear as to whether their punishment was
 considered by them to be a curse or a blessing.


 Other Heresies of this Age

 Among the various other heresies and errors is one that is rife,
 and this is troubling for it is not organised, but comes up
 from nowhere like flies.

 There is no cozening preacher to turn the Simple from God's
 path, and yet many in the world declare and maintain that the

[page="5"]
[backing="paper.pcx"]
[font 3]
 world upon which we stand is not the Earth that God has made,
 but another world made neither by God or the Devil.

 Among their lesser heresies, these people do deny the year of
 our Lord, saying that it is not the Fourteenth Century since
 Jesus the Christ was born, but the Twenty-Second, even though
 the LORD Himself has commanded that they recant their errors.

 Certain of these heretics also declare that the way to
 enlightenment is through the studying of the world around us,
 and not through the teachings of Christ and the Prophets of
 the LORD.  They believe that by such study it is possible to
 build miraculous devices that can perform many wonders,
 such as images that move as if alive, and steeds of iron that
 can carry a man and yet fly.
 
 These hereticks do say that a golden age of wonder and beauty
 was ended by our return to the holiness of Church Law, and
 they long to go back to the decadance and iniquity of days
 that the LORD has justly banished.

 To be certain, there are many heretical texts that describe
 their miraculous devices and how the simpler ones may be built
 by men.  These texts must be kept far from the reach of the
 Simple; our flocks must be kept free from the works of such
 infidels who the LORD Himself has condemned.
