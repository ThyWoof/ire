Excerpts from 'The Discoverie of Witchcraft', 1584


Some say that they can keep divils and spirits
in the likenesses of todes and cats


"It may not be omitted, that certein wicked women
following Sathan's provocations, being seduced by
the illusion of divels, beeleve and professe that in
the night times they ride abroad with Diana, the
goddesse of the Pagans, or else with Herodias, with
an innumerable multitude, upon certeine beasts, and
passe over manie countries and nations, in the
silence of the night, and doo whatsoever those
fairies or ladies command."




This hearb [hemlock] is called commonly Mirilidium
for it taketh away wit and reason.
