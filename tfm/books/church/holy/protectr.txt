            A Treatise on the Protectorate

          by Father Norrick of New Chelmsford


 Mighty though our LORD is, His powers are finite.  For is it
 not written that on the seventh day He did rest?  Did not Adam
 hide himself from the LORD, that he could not be found?

 Though some preach the creed of an omniscient God, our LORD
 Himself has revealed that this is not quite the case, during
 the famous mass of 1073.

 The LORD needs us, His faithful, to help relieve the burdens of
 the running of the world of Men.  Our LORD should not be
 distracted from His magnificent plan and greater works by the
 petty wrongs of the Simple.

 And so it falls unto us to free the LORD from the chore of
 administering the laws of His lower realm, that His divine
 attention may be focussed on the work of higher things.

 Now, the petty disputes of the Simple are dealt with by the
 King, under the guidance of the Church, by whom the Law of the
 Land is codified.  But there are times when Sin is committed
 against the Church itself.  Heresies and the machinations of
 the Evil One are rife throughout the Land.

 Sins of a religious nature must be dealt with by the LORD
 Himself, or those chosen and appointed by Him for such tasks.
 A new order was founded for this purpose; The Protectorate.
 The Protectorate exists to defend our faith.
 Its duties are as follows:

 Firstly, responding to an outbreak of Evil.

 Secondly, investigating the Evil where it occurs.

 Thirdly, subduing the Evil with all necessary force.

 And lastly, detecting and eradicating Evil before it becomes
 apparent.

 Since the power of the Adversary is nearly as great as that
 of our LORD, it is necessary and just that the Protectorate
 has powers above and beyond that of the common man, or
 indeed all but the highest members of the Church itself.

 The Protectorate answers only to the LORD and His Holiness
 the Pope.  With so much at stake, it is the duty of the faithful
 to give total cooperation to the Protectorate, for anything less
 would assist the Evil One in his struggle against our LORD.
