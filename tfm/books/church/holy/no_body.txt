                Notes On The Second Coming

                    Pope Harris, 1330


 It is written that 'Jesus has no body on earth but us.'

 The helpless form of a wandering spirit is hardly befitting
 to the Son of God, so a new body must be found as soon as
 is practical, to enable the Second Coming.

 The LORD has identified the most suitable candidate, but
 it is not yet time to claim him.
