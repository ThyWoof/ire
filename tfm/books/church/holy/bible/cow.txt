            The Second Book of Kings, Chapter Two


  23   And Elisha went unto Bethel, and as he was going by
       the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
       and they mocked him, calling "Baldy!  Baldy!"

  24   And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed
       them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth
       two she-bears out of the wood, and slew forty two of
       the children.

  25   And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from
       there he returned to Samaria.
