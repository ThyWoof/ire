                         The Book of Daniel
                              Chapter 4

  30  The king spoke, saying "Is this not the great Babylon,
      which I did build as the seat of my throne by the might
      of my power, and for the glory of my majesty?"

  31  And as the King said this, there came a voice from
      Heaven which spoke, saying "KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR,
      YOUR KINGDOM IS GONE FROM YOU."

  32  "YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM MEN, AND LIVE
      AMONG THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD!  YOU SHALL
      EAT GRASS AS CATTLE DO FOR SEVEN YEARS UNTIL
      YOU LEARN WHO TRULY RULES THE KINGDOM OF
      MEN, AND GRANTS IT TO ANYONE HE CHOOSES."

  33  And at that moment the prophecy came true for the
      King, for he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen.
      The hairs of his body were like eagles' feathers, and his
      nails like birds' claws.
