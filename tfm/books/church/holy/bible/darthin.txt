            The Wisdom of Darthinia, Chapter Six

  11   And Christ entered the Temple of Jere'bim, and saw
       that it had become the abode of charlatans and thieves.

  12   Now the Temple was apart from Jere'bim, and surrounded
       by mountains, so Jesus did command his disciples to climb
       these hills and look not towards the Temple for a day
       and a half.

  13   And at the mid of following day, Christ did enter back
       in to the Temple with empty hands, and at that moment
       the wrath of the LORD rained down upon the Temple.

  14   From Christ's body there came a light brighter even than
       the sun, and the Temple was consumed in holy fire.
       A great and terrble cloud did rise, a pillar of fire.
       The rocks did melt and the sand around became as glass.

  15   Then did Jesus return among his disciples, saying unto
       them, 'Let no man walk where the Temple stood for one
       score and five years, lest he shall die.'
