                  The Discoverie of Witchcraft

                        By Reginald Scot


 [ This tome describes various acts of witchcraft with a view
  to disproving the existence of witches.

  This edition is abridged, and has been re-edited by the Church
  for use as a guide to help prospective witchfinders tell if an
  accused woman is really a witch or not.]
