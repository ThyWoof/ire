                       The Holy Bible

  [ This isn't an edition I've ever seen before.  The wording
   is in an English vernacular that I can follow quite readily;
   most unusual for a medieval work.

   There are frequent references to the Holy Trinity in the
   New Testament, and an emphasis on martyrdom is made
   throughout the book.  All in all, this edition has a distinctly
   warlike outlook.
  
   There are also several extra books including the gospel of
   Aquinas, which describes how it is the fate of the common
   man to endure the hardships of this life as penance for
   Adam's original sin.]
