                An Essay on the Holy Ghost

                    By Cardinal Trom


 The Holy Ghost is, as a ghost, without form and so when
 needing to visit the World of Men, the Holy Spirit will posess
 the body of another for the time of His visit to the Earthly
 Realm.

 The spirit of our LORD will usually enter the body of an
 animal.  Birds are preferred because they have the power of
 flight, and it is known that it is much more hard for the Devil
 to posess a bird or beast than it is to posess a man.  Of course
 it is easy for the LORD, Creator of All Things to take a bird,
 and so by this the apparition is distinguished from Evil Works.

 It can be guessed what purpose the Holy Ghost has come to do
 by the kind of bird He has taken.  If the deed be a peaceful
 one, a dove will often be used.  If the deed be violent or of
 the highest importance, a kestrel or eagle may be chosen.

 When the spirit of the LORD leaves the bird, the creature will
 be confused for a short while.  One should never, ever try to
 capture or kill the bird after the Ghost is just left, for the
 LORD considers this an attack against Him and His authority.

 Such times as the Simple have tried to catch the Holy Bird for
 to eat it are few, but this has been tried, and those responsible
 did die in a most slow and terrible way by the LORD's anger.

 It is a better thing for all concerned if one should treat birds
 and beasts well and with care, in case the LORD is watching
 through them.
