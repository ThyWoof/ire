                 Dame Juliana Berners


 The Grayling by an other name called Umbre is a ryght delcious
 fysshe to mannis mouthe, and ye may take him as ye do the
 Troute, and these ben his baytes.

 In Marche & in Apryll the read worme. In May the greene worme,
 a lytle braised worme, the docke canker and the hauthorne worme.
 In Iune the bayte that breedeth betwene the tree and the barke of
 an Oke. In Iuly a bayte that bredeth on a ferne lefe and a great
 red worm and nyp of the head and put it on your hooke, and a
 cod worme before, in August the read worme and a Docke worme,
 and all the yere after a read worme.

 The Barbell is a swete fysh but it is a qualy meat and perylous
 for a mans body. For commonly he gyueth an introduction to the
 febres. And yf that he be eaten rawe, he may be cause of
 mannes deth, whiche hath oftentymes bene sene.
 These be his baytes. In Marche and in Apryll take a fayre freshe
 chese, and laye it on the borde, and cut it in small square peces
 of the length of your hooke. Than take a candell and brenne it
 at the ende at the poynt of the hooke vnto the tyme that it be
 yelowe, and than bynde it on your hooke with fletchers sylke,
 and make it tough lyke a welbede, this bayte is good all the
 sommer season.
 In May and Iune take the hautorne worme, & the great red worme,
 & nip of ye head and put vpon your hooke a cod worme before,
 and that is a good bayte. In Iuly take the read worme for chese,
 & the hauthorne together, also the water docke lefe worme together
 in August, and for al the yere, take the talow of a shepe, and
 soft chese of eche like much, & a lytel hony, & grinde or stampe
 them together long & temper it till it be tough and put thereto
 a lytell floure, & make it in small pelletes & that is a good
 bait to angle wt at the ground, & loke yt it sinke in the water,
 or else it is not good to this purpose.
