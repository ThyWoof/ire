                  Astrology and the Church

                   Maura of New Avignon


 In years past, astrology was considered a heretical practice
 and a kind of witchcraft, as such forbidden by the LORD.
 But there were some who did practice it despite, and would
 cast the future by the stars for any man who would pay.

 In 1103, Heironymous of Birnham was charged by the Cardinals
 of the Protectorate with witchcraft and heretical practices.

 In that most famous trial, Heironymous quoth: "I do declare and
 maintain that there be signs in the stars by which one can
 foretell what is to come."

 The chief Protector, Cardinal Trom so replied: "In attempting
 to foretell the future, you question the plan of the almighty
 GOD.  Deny at once that there are signs in the stars!"

 But the glory of the LORD filled the room and He spoke saying:
 "OF COURSE THERE ARE SIGNS IN THE STARS;
  I PUT THEM THERE MYSELF!

  THOSE WHO HAVE WISDOM MAY READ THEM AND KNOW
  MY PLANS.  RELEASE THIS MAN AT ONCE!"

 And Heironymous did praise God for freeing him, and Trom too
 prayed to God for forgiveness.  As penance for his error, the
 Cardinal deleted from the laws of the Protectorate and
 the courts of the Church, the crime of astrology, so that any
 may practice the seeing arts without fear of angering the
 LORD or his servants.
