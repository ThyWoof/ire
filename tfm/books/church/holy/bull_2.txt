 Papal Bull on Swimming Pool, 6th March 1302


 The LORD has decreed to me that the Holy Land does require
 a pool be built for purposes of swimming and like activities.

 It shall be 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide.  It shall be
 10 cubits deep at the deep end and 2 cubits deep at the shallow
 end and finished with tiles of finest marble.

 Any man who does wish to swim therein shall pay a fee not
 less than 5 gold coins.

 Construction shall begin on the day of this new moon and must
 be completed before Christmas Mass.  If this happens not, those
 responsible shall face the wrath of the LORD Himself.

 By order of the Holy Trinity,

     Pope Harris
