                   Memoirs of the Lord God
             The book of the Exodus, Chapter Two


  And one day, Moses did see a man slapping a Hebrew,
  and seeing that there was no-one else around, Moses did
  murder the man and hide the pieces.

  And as Moses did walk through the town, he heard the people
  saying "..and the only other guy around was Moses.. Aah!
  Here he comes now.. Run!"  And Moses did say unto himself
  "Oops, rumbled!" and he did flee the land of Egypt.

  And after many years, Moses did come to the holy mountain,
  whereupon he saw a vision of the Lord God in the form of a
  burning bush.  And the Lord did speak to Moses, saying:

  "You!  Come here, Moses.  I have a job for you to do.
  You shall go back to Egypt, and you shall persuade the Pharoah
  to free My people."

  And Moses spoke to the Lord, saying "But, Lord.  Nothing
  I can say will make him do this thing.  What shall I do?"

  And the Lord spoke to Moses and said "I shall guide you,
   Moses.  It is true, the Pharoah will not free his people
   at first.  But after a little 'encouragement' he will be
   more than happy to do so.

  "I shall cause many miracles to occur.  Some will truly be
   of joy and wonder, and some will really suck."

  But Moses replied saying "I cannot do this thing.  I am clumsy,
  stupid and bad with words."  And the Lord did say to Moses,
  "Shut up.  I am going to send Aaron with you.  He will help."

  And Moses did speak against the Lord, saying "No, no, Master.
  Please find someone else to do it."

  And the Lord's wrath rose against Moses, and He spoke saying
  "Don't try to worm out of this, you snivelling little man.
   Go to the Pharoah within the hour or I'll break your nose."
  And Moses did turn pale and tremble, and the LORD did calm
  down, saying "Good.  Now, go to your right and take that
  stick there as your staff.  With this shall you do stuff."
  And Moses did obey.
