                  The Discoverie of Witchcraft

                        By Reginald Scot


 [ This tome describes various acts of witchcraft with a view
  to disproving the existence of witches.

  This edition is complete, and describes in depth how some
  apparently magical deeds can be feigned using sleight of hand
  and other such tricks.  It also includes a section on how to
  juggle.]
