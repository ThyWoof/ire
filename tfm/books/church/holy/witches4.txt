            A True Tale Of Witchcraft - Sprenger

  A little girl, walking with her father in his land, heard
  him complain of drought, wishing for rain.
  "Why, father!" she said, "I can make it rain or hail when
   and where I wish!"

  Her father asked her where she learned this.  She said it
  was her mother, who forbade her to tell anybody of it.
  He asked her how her mother taught it.  She answered that
  her mother committed her to a Master, who would at any
  time do anything for her.

  "Why then," said he, "make it rain, but only in my field."
  And so she went to the stream, and threw up water in the
  air, in her Master's name, and made it rain presently.
  And proceding further with her father, she made it hail in
  another field, at her father's request.

  And so he accused his wife of witchcraft, and caused her
  to burned, and re-christened his daughter by a new name.
