# Flight of the Maxima
An Ultima-style CRPG

## SDL2 backend TODOs:
* Key debouncing is still erratic and sometimes eats keypresses
* Text input is kludgy and assumes a US/UK keyboard, ideally needs a rewrite
* Text input is glitchy for uppercase characters, rewrite should fix this

## Gameplay TODOs:
* Make combat system suck less
* Levelling up (currently the player starts able to lift an Otari MX80 studio recorder)

## Scripting and plot TODOs:
* Re-balance the economy, it's like the Weimar Republic in places
* Add journal entries for main plot points
* Establish extent of plot, find gaps, write (or find notes on) material to bridge gaps

## Quest TODOs:
* Add NPCs to lead to Liche quest
* Need to allow the player to get the special protective armour for dam quest
