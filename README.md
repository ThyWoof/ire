# Flight of the Maxima
An Ultima-style CRPG

# SDL2 backend TODOs:
* Throttle when idle to stop it overheating the GPU
* Mouse doesn't work in fullscreen
* Mouse pointer doesn't change icon properly
* Text input is not working properly (scancode -> ascii needs replacing, SDL_StartTextInput?)
* Broken text input means you cannot quit the map editor!
