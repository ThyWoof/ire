Changes:
BGui v2.0.4JM -- 17 Mar 2011:
    Joseph Morris:
	A number of changes to keep the library running.  It has had a tendency
	to lock up under X11 owing to a mixture of scare_mouse() and
	acquire_screen() calls which worked nicely under DJGPP, but can cause
	catastrophic failure under more recent versions of Allegro.
	See the SCARE_MOUSE and ACQUIRE_SCREEN macros.
	In addition I have been reworking parts of the library so it does not
	use any deprecated Allegro functions anymore.  It should tide us over
	until such time as IRE is ported to Allegro 5.0, at which point I'll
	probably need to write my own BGUI replacement anyhow

BGui v2.0.3 -- 16 Nov 2002:
    Alexandre Pineau:
	Released of the library under a gift-ware license
BGui v2.0.2 -- 20 Jan 2001:
    Jason Winnebeck:
	Quickly added ability for editboxes and listboxes to be D_DISABLED
BGui v2.0.1 -- 19 Oct 2000:
    Jason Winnebeck:
        Reformatted the text files -- they were wrapped to 88 characters, not
        78.  Added .sh and .bat files to convert text types and copy the
        proper makefile to Makefile.

        Fixed btest.c to not lock up in Windows when taking a screen shot.
        Removed ununsed variables (got rid of some warnings).

    Chris de Sousa:
        Added 2 makefiles, 1 for dos and 1 for linux.

        Made a few changes to btest.c to make it compile with glibc,
        the itoa function is not standard, so i used sprintf instead.

        Also changed the structure a bit, sources in src/, docs in /docs,
        libs in /lib.
