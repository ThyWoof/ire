Keywords understood by the NPC script engine.
=============================================

[page="name"]

The page called 'name' starts here.  The first page should usually be called
'start'.  This is the default if one hasn't been specified.

As of 0.80 the engine will also look for 'startname' if the player knows the
NPC's name (it will default to 'start' if there isn't one).
See also [ifknowname]



[endpage]

The current page stops here.



[link_colour="#123456"]

Set the colour for all page links to be 0x12 Red, 0x34 Blue, 0x56 Green
(god knows what colour that would be)

Also called: link_color, linkcolour, linkcolor, links



[colour="#123456"]

Set the colour for all text to be 0x12 Red, 0x34 Blue, 0x56 Green
(god knows what colour that would be)

Also called: color


[font 2]

Set the font used on the page to font number 2.  There are currently 8
font banks, the system font is 0, and the default conversation font is 1.
If you load fonts into other banks (using -loadfont <n> <filename> in
the .gam file, you can use this to select them.
If the font is a coloured font, (like the DOOM font) the font's colours
will be used by default.  If you set the colour yourself, the font will
be displayed opaquely in that colour.


[link_offset=16]

Set the position of the Links menu to be 16 pixels to the right.
You can use this to align the links against a background image.

Also called: linkoffset, link_x, linkx



[backing="filename.pcx"]

Use the file 'pics/filename.pcx' as a background image.



[image="spritename"]

Look in the resource.txt file for a sprite called 'spritename' and use
that as the portrait at the top of the page.



[nextpage="mypage"]

At the end of the page, wait for a key and then jump to 'mypage' as the
next page.



[delay 3]

When the page is drawn, wait 3 seconds before showing the page links.
This is useful for a plot-critical conversation that appears from nowhere
(e.g. mobile phone rings, or a passing god speaks to the player etc.).
This guarantees the user will see it and not skip it instantly because
they are holding down the arrow keys to move.



[left="mypage"]

At the end of the page, wait for a key and then jump to 'mypage' if the
left arrow was pressed.



[right="mypage"]

At the end of the page, wait for a key and then jump to 'mypage' if the
left arrow was pressed.



[goto="mypage"]

Jump immediately to 'mypage', without displaying the rest of the page
being parsed.  Use this before the page body to jump to other pages when
certain conditions are met.



[append="mypage"]

Jump immediately to 'mypage', without displaying the rest of the page
being parsed, OR clearing the screen.  This effectively splices two pages
together.  It is especially useful for having a common set of links for
several different pages.



[random_page="mypage 00 99"]

Constructs a random numbered page name, from the given parameters.
The first parameter is the base name of the page, the second parameter is the
starting number, and the third parameter is the number of pages in the range.

For example, [random_page="mypage 00 03"] will jump to one of the following
pages:

	mypage00
	mypage01
	mypage02
	mypage03

Useful for making 'fortune cookies' or random hints.  Jump behaviour is the
same as [goto=]



[link="conversation subject"]

Add a new link to the menu at the bottom of the page.  Link adds the
heading, e.g. "What is your name?".  It must be followed by linkto.



[linkto="newpage"]

Adds the destination of the link being constructed.  This is the page it
jumps to when you choose the menu option.  It must be preceded by link.



[alt_link="conversation subject"]

If you have already chosen the above link in a previous conversation, the
menu option will be replaced with the alternate text given here,
e.g. "what was your name again?"
You must have both a link= and linkto= statement just before this command.

Also called: altlink



[alt_linkto="mypage"]

Like alt_link, you can also specify an alternate destination page for the
conversation after the link has been seen the first time.
e.g. "As I've told you before, you must look for the golden staff.."

Also called: altlinkto



[always]

If this is placed just after a link, that link will always be show.
As of 0.81, the default behaviour is to only show a link once each
time the player talks to an NPC.


[resetlinks]

Forget which pages the user has visited.  If you put this on the first
page, links marked with [once] will effecitvely be shown once each time
you talk to the NPC, rather than once for the entire game, which is the
default behaviour.
